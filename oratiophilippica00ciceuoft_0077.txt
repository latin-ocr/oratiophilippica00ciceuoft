and deposited in the temple of Ops which was plundered by Antony:
an explanation gathered from the context and the use of the word
dissipare, cp. v. 11 illa vero dissipatio pecuniae publicae, VI. 3 pecunia
publica dissipata atque effusa. On the other hand it seems improbable
that Cicero should have called this treasure reliquiae rei publicae, and
the meaning is more likely to be that the hopes of a restoration of the
republic excited by the death of Caesar were quickly extinguished by
the despotic acts of Antony: “and that too when you had scattered to
the winds the last relics of the republic''. [So too Dr Reid who
translates ‘the last traces of free government' and cp. Cic. off. 11. 29
rem publicam penitus amisimus, 1. 35 rem publicam quae nunc nulla
est, 11. 3.]

18 mercatu] refers to the venality practised by Antony in pretended
compliance with Caesar's will, which was opened and read in Antony's
house: Suet. Caes. 83 testamentum eius aperitur recitaturque in Antonii
domo. The Philippics teem with references to Antony’s greed and
venality.

19 promulgatae] by the lex Caecilia Didia of 98 and the Licinia Iunia
of 62 it was enacted that every law should be promulgated three weeks‚
trinis nundinis, before it was voted on, in order that the people might
make themselves acquainted with its contents. This Antony had neg·
lected to do: cp. Phil. V. 8 ubi lex Caecilia et Didia? ubi promulgatio
trinum nundinum ? ubi poena recenti lege Iunia et Licinia? possuntne
lzae leges esse ratae sine interitu legum reliquarum? 1. 25 illae enim
(leges) sine ulla promulgatione latae sunt ante quam scriptae.

20 confiterere] ‘allowed’, i.e. when charged with it you did not deny it.

auspicia augur] notice the emphatic juxtaposition of these two
words, and of intercessionem consul: an augur should have been the last
person in the world to disregard the auspices, and a consul was above
all others bound, as chief magistrate, to respect the right of intercession-
Antony though augur set at nought the auspices on more than one
occasion ; cp. Phil. V. 7, 8 and 10 where Cicero sums up quibus de
caussis eas leges quas M. Antonius tulisse dicitur, omnis censeo per vim
et contra auspicia latas eisque legibus populum non teneri: and see notes
on ἓ 80 foll. For his disregard of the tribunicial right of intercession
cp. Phil. Ι. 2 5, where Antony is represented as saying neglegimus ista
(tribunicial rights and other customs) et nimis antz'qua ac stulta ducimus.

23 vino lustrisque confectus] ‘worn out by drunkenness and debauchery'.
