62 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [VIII 20

uxor is used ironically as Cytheris was not married to Antony: she was
an actress.

¹4 cedant arma togae] part of a line, cedant arma togae, concedat laurea
laudi, which occurred in Cicero’s poem ‘de suis temporibus' written
probably in B-C. 54. Only one other line from it has been preserved,
o fortunatam natam me consule Romam. These poor jingling lines
afforded his contemporaries much theme for scorn, cp. Off. Ι. 77 illud
autem optimum est in quod invadi solere ab improbis et invidis audio:
‘cedant' &c.; Pis. 73, 74 where Cicero condescends to explain his
meaning sor Piso's benefit. For the meaning of toga see above note on

atque illam beluam, iudici laqueos declinantem, iam irretitam teneret,
qui locus, quod tempus illud, a'i immortales, ficit! cum se ille fugiens in
scalarum tenebris abdidisset, magnum Miloni suit conficere illam pestem
nulla sua inmitia, Μ. vero Antoni maxima gloria. This took place in
53 when Antony was a candidate for the quaestorship3 cp. ἕ 49.

28 scalas tabernae librariae] ‘the staircase of a bookshop’. Whole
