the coast in July after many stoppages on the way at various
country villas, and took ship to Rhegium whence he paid a
hasty visit to Syracuse. From Rhegium he set sail for Greece
in August, but was driven back by contrary winds. He then
heard that there was a change for the better in the political
outlook at Rome and that there was a prospect of the return of
Brutus and Cassius. He thereupon hurried back to be in time
for the full meeting of the senate announced for the 1st of
September. He arrived on the last day of August, but being
by his own account fatigued by his journey he did not attend
the house on the first, having naturally no desire to hear Antony
propose a public thanksgiving in Caesar's honour. Thereupon
Antony furious at his absence and supposed indecision threaten-
ed to pull or burn down his house if he did not come. On the
2nd Cicero attended and delivered his first Philippic in which
he gently expostulated with Antony, who was not present, for
his conduct. The tone of the speech was throughout conciliatory
and judicious. But nothing could appease Antony's resentment
against his old foe. He spent about a fortnight, if Cicero may
be trusted, practising declamation in Scipio⁷s villa at Tivoli‚
and on the 19th appeared in the senate house which he had
surrounded with his armed retainers and delivered a vehement
invective against Cicero who prudently stayed away. In reply
to·this attack Cicero wrote, but never delivered, the famous
second Philippic which for lofty eloquence and scathing irony
has seldom if ever been surpassed. It was not published till
after Antony’s departure from Rome. The third and fourth
Philippics were delivered in December; the remaining ten in
the spring of 43. On the 7th of December of that year Cicero
was murdered near Caieta by order of the triumvirs Antony,
Lepidus, and Octavian who cemented their alliance bya general
proscription of the most prominent of their personal enemies
amounting, it is said, to many hundred persons.
