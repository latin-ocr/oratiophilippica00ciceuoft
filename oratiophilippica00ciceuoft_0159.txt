XL 103] NOTES. 131

ς 102.

19 Casilinum] Cicero says Att. XVI. 8 (written 2 Nov.) that Octavian
had won over the veterans stationed at Casilinum, a town near Capua ;
cp. Veu. 11. 61 C. Caesar (Octavian)...a Casilino veteranos exczvit
paternos.

20 consuluisti] ‘you consulted me it is true (quidem) by letter about
Capua, but Ι should have given you the same answer about Casilinum’
(if you had consulted me, as Ι did about Capua).

21 possesne] this is the purport of Antony's enquiry: (you asked me)
‘whether you could ’, ἃς.

23 auspicato] ‘under proper auspices': this absolute use of the ablative
of the perfect passive participle is not uncommon in Cicero, but was
widely extended in later Latin.

24 adscribz] ‘enrolled’: though a new colony could not be taken to
a place where there was already one properly established, yet fresh
individual colonists could be added to the register of the old.

27 vexillum tolleres] a colony proceeded to its destination in military
order with a flag (vexillum), cp. leg. agr. ΙΙ. 86 illud Campanae vexillum
coloniae; on arrival the ground to be occupied was marked out with a
plough: the flag and the plough are sometimes found on coins struck by
Roman colonies. Roman colonisation was almost universally connected
with military service.

29 perstrinxisti] ‘grazed’, perhaps praestrinxz'stz' should be read: in leg.

agr. 11. 67 perstringere aratro is used of ‘just cutting through’ a hard soil
with the plough.

31 Casinatem] Casinum now represented by M. Cassino about two
miles from S. Germano and eight from Pontecorvo. Here lived for a
time the most learned of the Romans, M. Terentius Varro, born 116,
died 37. He is said to have written 490 books or treatises, among them
the de lingua Latina, in 24 books, of which a great part remains.

32 quo ore] ‘with what face' ; so we say ‘ how had you the face to do it?’
‘cheek’ is an exact but vulgar equivalent of os in this sense.

P· 37. 1 et si ab hasta] ‘and if <you came into possession of it) by
purchase at an auction’: Antony asserted that it was purchased from
Caesar at the time of the Alexandrian war when Varro was fighting on
the side of Pompey.
