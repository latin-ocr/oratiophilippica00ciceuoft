82 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XVII 42

7 itt aliena villa] the villa of Q. Metellus Scipio, who was Pompey’s
father-indam and his colleague in the consulship of 52: cp. Fam. ΧΠ.
2 § 1 cum in villa Metelli compluris dies commentatus esset ; quae
autem. . .in vino commentatio potuit esse ,9

8 exhalandi] cp. ξ 30 l. 33: there are some indications that this word
should be spelt without the k.

10 suffragio...rlzetorem] cp. ἓ 8 lzomo diserte, ut Tironi et Mustelae iam
esse videris.

1 1 omnino] ‘by all means' used concessively: ‘a witty man no doubt'.

12 dicta dicere] ‘to utter witticisms' ; this is a common meaning of dicta,
cp. Plane. 85 admonuisti etiam, quod in Creta fuisses, dictum aliquod in
petitionem tuam dici potuisse.

dicere] what grammarians call an epexegetic infinitive, following the
substantive materia, and equivalent to a genitive case: Cicero might
have written materia dictorum dicendorum (or dicendi), ep. Livy, Ι. 22
materiam excitandi belli quaerebat. This kind of infinitive is not com-
mon3 R. ἓ 1360, Draeg. 112. ἓ 445.

13 avom] M. Antonius born 143, consul 99, slain in the proscription of
the adherents of Sulla by Marius and Cinna 87. See Brut. 139—142
for Cicero’s judgement of him as an orator.

sensim] ‘with deliberation' opposed to cursim ‘glibly’.

ξ 43.

16 duo milia iugerum] if we reckon a iugerum as {ths of an acre—a
slightly exaggerated estimate—this would amount to 1250 acres.

17 Leontini] the town of Leontini, now Lentini, was situated between
Catana and Syracuse; the land was very fertile and was a partos the
domain land (publicus ager) of the Roman people.

et quidem] ‘and that too’.
18 tanta mercede] ‘at such a cost’ to the Roman people.
nihil sapere] cp. ἓ 19 1. 9.

20 alio loco] ἓ 101.

23 emendatore et correctore] Cicero likes to join these words3 cp. Balb.
20 correctorem atque emendatorem nostrae civitatis3 Acad. 1. 13 recentis-
sima quaeque sunt correcta et emendata maxime3 Leg. 111. 30 emendari
et corrigi (solet civitas) continentia ; so too Tac. Hist. 1. 38 castra emen·
data et correcta, and other writers.

24 effundam] ‘I will not squander all my arguments’.
