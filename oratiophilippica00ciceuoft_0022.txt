of you! What would you say, and how show off your eloquence
to your armed satellites (by the way, Ι wonder whether your
eloquence could defend them on a charge of homicide !) if I were
to deny that I wrote it? How could you prove it, expett
though you are in handwriting? ξ 9. But I do not deny it.
F ool that you are, you object to it because Ι wrote it in a
friendly and respectful tone, as though Ι were addressing a good
man. Ι will not read your letter in which you ask me to restore
one of your friends from exile. Why should Ι interfere in your
headlong course? ξ 10. You had Caesar's permission to restore
him, why ask for mine?

Ι hope the senate will give me a patient hearing when Ι
speak against you and for myself. Ι can hardly treat you as a
true consul. ξ 11. My consulship was devoted to the service
of the senate; you and Clodius (the bane of whose life is yours
too) alone censured it. ξ 12. Many good and able men, now
dead, warmly praised my consulship. ξ 13. So does L. Cotta,
who still lives, who decreed me a unique honour; ξ 14. so
does your Uncle L. Caesar, whom you ought to have made
your friend and adviser, instead of the profligates ξ 15. whose
society you frequent. Do you assert in this temple, hallowed
by such memories, that your consulship is better than mine?
ξ 16. All the best men in Rome flocked to the Capitol to guard
the senate, not bands of slaves to force it, as you pretend.
ξ 17. No one sailed in that hour of peril. You assert falsely
that Ι refused to let your stepfather be buried. ξ 18. Why
remind us of your connection with him? Your speech was
contradictory in reference to your step-father's punishment.
ξ 19. Again how can you talk of the armed force on the Capitol
in my consulship when this temple is beset with your retainers?
ξ 20. You laughed at my verses, but you are not the person to
judge either my verses or my conduct.

ξ 21. You said that Ι instigated the murder of Clodius; or
at all events rejoiced at it: you once tried to kill him yourself.
ξ 22. No one charged me with this at the enquiry.

ξ 23. You say I caused the war by severing Pompey and
Caesar; your dates are wrong3 I once tried to do so long
