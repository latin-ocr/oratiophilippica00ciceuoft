8 meum consilinm auctoritasque] cp. Att. VIII. 3 ξ 3 nihil actum est a
Pompeio nostro sapienter, nz‘lzz‘lfhrtz‘ter, addo etiam, nz'lzil nisi contra con-
silium auctoritatemque meam, written in Feb. 49. Cicero was opposed
to Pompey's leaving Italy and thought that he should have accepted any
condition rather than thus abandon his country 3 he was anxious to take
upon himself the office of peacemaker between Caesar and Pompey, but
as he sadly says, Att. VIII. 11 ἓ 2 ‘neither of them makes our happiness
his aim, each wishes to reign’

9 tu hodie egeres] Cicero is perhaps thinking of the straits to which he
and Pompey were reduced at the time in question, cp. Att. XI. 3 ξ 3

sumus, and VIII. 2 ξ 3 written in Feb. 49 vagamur egentes cum coniugi·
bus et liberis.

12 maestitia] Cicero’s despondency is attested by Plutarch, Cic. 38
αὐτὸς μὲν ἀγέλαστος ἀεὶ περιιὼν ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ καὶ σκυθρωπός, and by
the tone of his letters to Atticus written from the camp, especially Att.
XI. 2 and 4 me conficit sollicitudo, ex qua etiam summa infirmitas cor-
poris ‘I am being worn out by anxiety‚ which has produced extreme
physical weakness’.

quanta] for the omission of in cp. ξ ²7 1. 23.

teretur implied in the participle dimissa.

angoribus] the plural suggests fits or periods of anguish ; so used in
Off. 11 2, where too the same verb conficere is used nec me angoribus
dedz‘di quibus essem confictus nisi eis restitissem.

18 praestantzlrsimos] according to Appian B. C. 11. 82 no less than 10
senators and 40 equites fell on Pompey's side in the battle of Pharsalus.
Caesar reckons Pompey's total loss at 15‚000. He states his own loss to
have been 30 centurions and 200 rank and file.
