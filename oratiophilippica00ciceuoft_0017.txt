a tumultuous meeting in the precincts of the Capitol. To
ensure the safety of the conspirators Antony sent them his
little son as a hostage. On the 18th another meeting of the
senate was held at which all the conspirators were present, and
the principal business that was transacted was the settlement

Bithynia, Cisalpine Gaul were assigned respectively to M.

Antony, after enumerating by the mouth of a herald the decrees
passed in Caesar’s honour, added a few laudatory remarks* on
the character of the deceased, which had a singular effect in
arousing the feelings of the assembled multitude. The excited
mob seized upon every combustible object within reach, piled

Cicero warmly praises him for killing the impostor Amatius
and for overthrowing the column of Numidian marble that
had been erected on the scene of the funeral. But Antony had

possessed of Caesar's treasure, he could exercise his art
effectively. It was not long before he bought over Dolabella,
whose defection was a great blow to Cicero and those who
wished to reestablish the old republic on a firm basis. Soon
after the funeral Antony had begun to promulgate a series of
arbitrary measures, which for the most part made the patriots
