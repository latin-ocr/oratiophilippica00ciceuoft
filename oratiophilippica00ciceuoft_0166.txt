138 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XLIII 110

ἕ 110.

8 et] for et introducing an indignant question cp. ἕ 39 1. 8.

10 pulvinar] a soft-cushioned couch placed before the statue of a god
at the time of the lectisternium or ‘feast of couches': the pulvinaris
figured in SDA. ‘lectisternium'. The use of one, as an attribute of
divinity‚ had been granted by the senate to Caesar. Dr Reid thinks the
reference here is to the pulvinar placed in the circus on the occasion of
the pompa Circensis, a solemn procession in connexion with the ludi
Romani and other public festivals; such a pompa was allowed Caesar,
cp. Suet. quoted on l. 11 and Festus p. 364 tensam ait vocari Sinnius
Capito vehiculum quo exuviae deorum ludicris Circensibus in circum ad
pulvinar velzuntur3 cp. Cic. Att. XIII. 44.

simulacrum] commonly used of the image of a divinity, and, as such,
the right of having one of himself was granted to Caesar. ”

fastigium] ‘a pediment'‚ a form of roof chiefly appropriated to
temples. The senate allowed Caesar to erect one on the front of his
house, thus making it resemble a temple; hence the fastigium is here
classed with the other divine honours bestowed on him. The night
before Caesar's murder his wife Calpurnia dreamed conlabi fastigium
domus, Suet. Caes. 81.

11 flaminem] each deity had a special priest, called a flamen, to wait on
him. Antonius was made Caesar's flamen, cp. Phil. X111. 41 cuius,
homo ingratissime, flaminium cur reliquisti? ἓ 47 Caesar (Octavianus)
cuius patris flamen est. Suetonius Caes. 76 thus enumerates the honours
granted to Caesar; ampliora etiam lzumano fastigio decerni sibi passus
est, sedem auream in curia et pro tribunali, tensam et ferculum Circensi
pompa, templa, aras, simulacra iuxta deos, pulvinar, flaminem, Lupercos,
appellationem mensis e suo nomine.

12 divo] this is perhaps the first instance of the word divos applied to the
deceased head of the state ; it afterwards became the recognised epithet of
the departed emperor. At the same time, as Caesar was worshipped as
‘Juppiter Julius ' during his lifetime‚ he may have been called divos even
then3 cp. Dio XLIv. 6.

13 inaug-uraris] ‘why are you not installed?’ the ceremony of installa-
tion of a flamen was performed by the Pontifex Maximus.

vide] ‘look for someone to instal you ' ε videre in the sense of ‘provide ’
is not uncommon.
