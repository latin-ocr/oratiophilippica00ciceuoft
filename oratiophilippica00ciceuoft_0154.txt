1 26 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXXVIII 97

Bills of this kind were sometimes affixed to the walls and some of
these notices have been found in Pompeii.

23 expendantur] in an earlier period when the old copper bars, stamped
with some device, but with no fixed indications of weight, were in
circulation, sums of money were regularly reckoned by weight‚ to which
practice we owe our word ‘ expense ' (expendere ‘to weigh out '). Cicero
is probably romancing here, but cp. Phil. 111. 10 at vero huius domi
inter quasilla pendebatur aurum, numerabatur pecunia.

24 avaritia] probably an ablative of description, the subject of est being
iste (Antony) ; it is possible however that Cicero is personifying avaritia,
‘but how blind is avan’ce ! '

25 Cretensium] Crete was conquered by Q. Caecilius Metellus (who
gained therefrom the cognomen Creticus) and made a Roman province
with Cyrene in 67. In June 44 Antony induced the senate to pass
a resolution appointing M. Brutus over the province of Crete and
C. Cassius over Cyrene with proconsular powers.

liberantur] freed from the provincial tax sometimes called tributum,
which must be distinguished from the tributum which had been levied
on all Roman citizens up to the year 167, cp. §93 1. 18. Lange 111².
504 points out that Caesar may have intended to treat Crete and
Sicily as he did Gallia Cisalpina, whose inhabitants he made cives
Romani, whereby they were freed from the tributum. Of course Crete
would not thereby cease to be a province, as Cicero chooses to assume.

27 constringendus] ‘ to be settered ' as a lunatic.

28 decessum] ‘ departure ' from the province ; not ‘ decease’, though the
words are the same.

29 nz‘ln'l ad Brutum] Caesar had intended Brutus to be in charge of the
province of Macedonia, which was changed by the senate, after his
murder, to Asia and then to Crete. It is clear then that Caesar could
not have arranged that Crete should cease to be a province at the close
of Brutus’ governorship, when he had never intended Brutus to have
anything to do with it.

30 ne... putetis] ‘that you may not think that no result was achieved ' ;
for the phrase nibil agere ‘to achieve a worthless result' see Mayor
on Juvenal Χ. 155, Reid on Aead. 11. 16.

31 perdidistis] another exaggeration.

omnino] ‘in a word no one proposed to buy anything, but Antony
was ready to sell it ’.
