84 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XVIII 44

2 Curio] see note on ξ 3 l. 16. At an earlier period Curio had been
held in high esteem by the optimates, and by Cicero in particular, who
addressed several letters to him Fam. 11. 1—-7‚ but that was before
B. C. 50, in which year Caesar purchased his adherence by the payment
of his debts, a transaction to which Lucan refers in the well-known line
momentumque suit mutatus Curio rerum (Phars. IV. 793—824); cp. Att.

VI. § .
gztejwmy] ‘appeared on the scene'.

ς 45.

4 pater] C. Scribonius Curi03 see note on ξ 12 1. 24.
domu] an admissible form of the ablative, though domo is more
common: domu sua is the reading of the best MS in Verr. 11. 5. 128.

6 mercede] ‘pay’: because Curio, in spite of his father’s wishes, was
unwilling to forego his intimacy with Antony and used to make him
presents of money.

demitterere] almost in middle sense, ‘let yourself down’.

10 te] this, not se, must be the right reading. The younger Curio
besought Cicero to defend Antony against the elder Curio, in case the
latter should sue Antony for the 6,000,000 sesterces, roughly speaking
A50,000, that his son who was still under the patria potestas had impro-
perly advaneed to him: the word petere points to a process of law, and
cannot be referred to a merely private request. J.S.R.

12 intercessisse] ‘to such an extent did he say that he had pledged his,
credit on your behalf’3 cp. Att. Vl. 1 ξ 5 ascribit..,intercessisse se pro
eis magnam pecuniam.

13 amore ardens] ‘in his passionate affection for you’.

confirmabat] ‘ assured me ’.
desiderium tui discidi] ‘the pain of separation from you’3 lit. the
yearning for you of (i.e. caused by) your separation from him.

ς 46.

15 florentzlrsz'mae familiae] familia is not used here in the restricted sense
so common in English of the members, parents and children, forming a
single household, but in the wider sense in which we sometimes use it,
as when we say ‘he belongs to the family of the Howards'. The young
Curio, his father and his grandfather, were all men of mark and ability,

cp. Plin. N. H. VII. 41 una familia Curionum in qua tres continua
serie oratores exstiterunt.
