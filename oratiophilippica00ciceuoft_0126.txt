98 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXVI 64

remains of this temple of ‘Jupiter the Stayer’, built, according to the
legend, by Romulus in gratitudo to the God for staying the defeat of the
Romans by the Sabines‚ Liv. 1. 12, Burn's Rome, p. 162.

18 subiecta] subicere voci praeconis (or sub praeconem) is a common
phrase, meaning ‘to put up for sale’. Orelli in his first edition omitted
subiecta Cn. Pompei as Quintilian Ix- 3. 29 quotes the passage without
them; Dr Reid would omit subiecta.

consumptis lacrimzk] concessive participle, ‘though my tears are used
up ’, ‘though I have no tears left to shed'‚ as below servientibus animis
‘though their spirits were enslaved'. Such a remark in a modern
speech would excite ridicule, but Cicero as an impressionable Italian
very likely did weep when he first heard of Pompey’s house being sold 3
he could not however summon a tear at a moment's notice in a speech
and therefore pretends that he has wept his eyes dry: cp. ξ 68 quam
domum...nemo sine lacrimis praeterire poterat.

2 3 liber fuit] ‘found free expression ’‚ cp. the common use of libertas in
the sense of παρρησία ‘freedom of speech’.

24 tam...lzostis] this apparent rather than real exception to the rule
stated in note on ἓ 18 l. 22, is not noticed by LS. The substantive
hostis is practically equivalent to an adjective, such as inimicus.

2 5 scelus sectionis] ‘wicked sale': this use of scelus with a genitive is
colloquial rather than literary, and is found in Plautus and Terence.

inventus est nemo] this is not true, as we learn from Cicero himself,
Phil. XIII. ἓ 11 (quoted by M.).

26 praesertim cum] ⁴ although', cp. note on ἓ 60 l. 12.

28 id quod] not ‘that thing which ⁹, but ‘such a thing as’, hence the
subjunctive.

ς 65.

29 stupor] cp. ξ 30 l. 23.

30 isto loco natus] ‘born in such a position as yours’.

31 Pompei] said with emphasis: the moral greatness (in Cicero's view)
of the person whose property Antony bought was an aggravation of the
offence.

32 populo] dative ‘in the sight of the Roman people‘.

33 et csse...et futuros] this double et when the same verb is used in
different tenses is very comm0n; cp. Verr. ΙΙ. 2. 15 intellegetis enim,
nullis hominibus quemquam tanto odio, quanto istum Syracusanis, et
esse etsuisse3 Phil. ΙΙΙ. 9 qualia innumerabilia etfacit et fecit Antonius.
