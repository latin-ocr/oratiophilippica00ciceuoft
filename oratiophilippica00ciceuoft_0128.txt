100 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXVII 67

15 dissipatas] ‘dispersed’, ‘seattered'. This participle is often united
with dispersus.

16 nihil...scrzptum] ‘to his pillaging hands nothing was barred, nothing
sealed, nothing secured in writing’: some such amplification of the
sentence is required in English.

17 apothecae] ἀποθῆκαι, ‘ warehouses'.

18 condonabantur] condono differs slightly from do or dono in implying
sreehanded, profuse giving ; cp. leg. agr. 15 sic confirmo, quirites, hac
lege agraria dari vobis nz'lzz‘l, condonari certis hominibus omnia.

19 referta] often used, like plenus, with a genitive: so we say ‘filled
with’ or ‘full of '.

20 atque id] ‘and that too ’, cp. idque in ἓ 2 3 l. 9.

suggerebantur] ‘were superadded’.

22 conchyliatis peristromatis] ‘purple-dyed coverlets': conchylium was a
light purple dye produced from a kind of shell-fish with an admixture of
other ngredients. The patchwork coverlets (centones) ordinarily used
by slaves were made of the commonest rags.

peristromatis] the word is a latinised form of περιστρώματα; for the
form of the ablative‚ cp. poematis, epigrammatis, aenigmatis.

cellis] ‘garret', ‘hut’, a word peculiarly applied to the dwellings of
slaves.

27 hortos] ‘ sc. occupavit as continuation of the foregoing invasit in sor·
tunas’ HM. ς perhaps supply devoravit from the nearer verb.

ἓ 68.

29 os ostendere] a not uncommon phrase in Cicero.
32 quamvis nilzil sapias] ‘devoid of sense as you are'; cp. ἓξ 19, 43.

p. 25. 1 rostra] probably spoils taken by Pompey in the pirate war.

2 putas] ‘do you think?': slightly irregular sequence of tenses3 one
might have expected putasti ‘did you think?’

3 sine sensu] ‘without feeling ², not ‘without sense’.

6 obiecta sit] this represents in a direct statement obiecta est, like cum
adspexisti above, but the clause being subordinate, the mood becomes
subjunctive. For the use of the word cp. Acad. ΙΙ. 49 si tale visum
obiectum est a deo dormienti, Div. 11. 143 visum est tale obiectum
dormienti.
