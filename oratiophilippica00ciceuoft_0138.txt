ς so.

7 hic] Antony, cp. below lzic bonus augur.

8 ostendisset] practically equivalent to ‘had promised ’, cp. Fam. IX. 8
ἓ 1, Att. 1x. 13 ς 4.

9 esse] this belongs to consulem, the esse belonging to iussurum is omitted,
as it often is with the participle in the future infinitive; in 1. 13 it is
inserted with facturum.

quem...diceret] ‘ and yet people deny that he was a king, though he
was always both doing and saying something of that kind ξ’ : after this
indignant parenthetical remark Cicero goes on with his story, resuming
the broken thread by the word sed.

12 eo] agrees with sacerdotio ‘ with that priestly office ’, viz. the augur-
ship.

13 vitiare] we use the same word ‘vitiate' in the same sense: the
magistrate whose electiori was vitiated was vitio factus or vitiosus, cp.
Phil. 111. 9 collega...quem ipse ementitis auspiciis vitiosum fecerat, below
ἓ 84 vitiosus consul Dolabella.

asseveravit] observe that a Roman augur could assert that on a
particular day he would see an unfavourable sign which would'vitiate
an important election, at least for the day3 a convincing proof of the
fraud and superstition that accompanied the observances of the state
religion3 cp. Dio XXXVIII. 13, MM. Ι. p. 6, note 4.

14 stupiditatem] a very rare word, only here used by Cicero; cp.§ 8
stultitiam incredibilem videte.

§J 81.

16 si...esses] ‘if you were ' (at the time), hence esses and not fuisses,
which at first sight might seem to be required to harmonise with the
pluperfect potuisses in the apodosis.

17 nos] by ‘ we ’ Cicero, being himself an augur, means the augurs; cp.
below ἓ 83 nostrum collegium.

nuntiationem] the whole of this passage ἓξ 80-84 requires a detailed

explanation ε the following attempt at an elucidation of the chief

difficulties is based on Mommsen’s ‘die Auspicien der Magistrate’ in

vol. Ι. pp. 3—41 of the ‘Handbook os Roman Antiquities’. nuntiatio ’

is a general expression for the right of announcing the will of the gods

as shown by various signs, which right was possessed alike by augurs
