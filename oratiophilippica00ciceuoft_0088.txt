60 ORA TI O PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [VII 1 7

were given up for burial, φησὶν Ἀντώνιος οὐδὲ τὸν νεκρὸν αὐτοῖς ἀποδοθῆναι
τοῦ Λέντλου πρότερον ἢ τῆς γυναικὸς τοῦ Κικέρωνος τὴν μητέρα δεηθῆναι.
τοῦτο μὲν οὖν ὁμολογουμένως ψεῦδός ἐστιν· οὐδεὶς γὰρ εἴρχθη ταφῆς τῶν
τότε κολασθέντων ὑπὸ τοῦ Κικέρωνος.

ς 18.

18 venit in mentem] ‘it occurs to you': students should remember that
in good Latin venit in mentem is used impersonally as here, or occasion-
ally with a pronoun or neuter adjective as subject, e.g. hoc mihi venit in
mentem or multa milti veniunt in mentem; such a construction as Cic.

Fam. IV. 13 ἓ 1 non modo certa res nulla, sed ne genus quidem litterarum
usitatum veniebat in mentem is very rare: otherwise the phrase is con-
structed with the genitive, e. g. venit in mentem mihi tuae epistulae
‘I call to mind your letter '.

redzgere in memoriam] the same phrase is quoted by LS. from
Fam. Ι. 9 ξ 9.

19 P. Lentuli] P. Cornelius Lentulus Sura, consul in 71, was afterwards

expelled from the senate on account of his gross immoralsty, δι’ ἀσέλ-

γειαν ἐξεληλάμενος τῆς βουλῆς Plut. Cic. 17. He had been Sulla's
quaestor, and was praetor in 63.

22 tam] to be taken with excors: tam as a demonstrative adverb of
intensity is used with adjectives and not with verbs, ita with verbs and
also with adjectives: tantum is often used with verbs in this sense, e.g.
rex tantum auctoritate eius motus est ut Sec. where tam would be incor-
rect: for the occasional use of non tam with verbs, cp. Madvig Fin. 1. 1.

tua tecum ipse] notice the accumulation of pronouns: ipse is redun-
dant but serves to add to the emphasis.

24 diiuncta atque contraria] cp. Acad. ΙΙ. 97 e contrariis diiunctio.

26 fuisse in] ‘took part in '.

30 quem contra] contra is ftequently thus put after the pronoun that
depends on it: [in prose it is rare to find a monosyllabic preposition

after its case; and then mostly in archaic phrases like quo de agitur.
J.S.R.]

ς 19.

31 cupit enim se audacem] supply esse and see note on ξ 14 l. 14.

P· 8. 1 armati] the Philippics are full of references to Antony’s conduct

in attempting to overawe the deliberations of the senate by bands os
armed men.
