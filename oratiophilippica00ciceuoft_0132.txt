104 ΘΚΑ T I O PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXIX 73

tabula] ‘ auction', properly a tablet containing an inventory of the
things to be offered for sale.

22 qui risus hominum] this exclamation is followed by an accusative
and infinitive clause, being syntactically equivalent to quem ad modum
ridebant hanzines.

2 3 partem Alisenz] ‘his share in Misenum ', cp. above, ἓ 48 end.

24 nihil erat] Antony was selling this property in order to satisfy
Caesar's claims‚ and it chiefly consisted of Pompey's effects which
Antony had bought but had not paid for! Hence the risus hominum.

26 eaque] ‘and what there was of it'.

27 sordidata mancipia] ‘slaves in squalid attire'; cp. Ter. Haut. 297
scin lzanc quam dicit sordidatam et sordidam ‘meanly clad and mean’,
Cic. Pis. 67 serm· sordidati ministrant.

ut doleremus] ‘so that we grieved'3 ut: ὥστε with infinitive, cp.
above, ἓ 40 l. 23.

ἓ 74.

29 heredes L. Rubri] Rubrius had left his property to Antony, to whom
he was a perfect stranger, passing over his nephew and the son of Q.
Fufius, who also had some claim on him, cp. ἐξ 40, 41. They probably
interfered with the auction on the ground of some invalidity, real or
alleged, in the will, such as that the testator was not of sound mind; or
the interferenee may have been purely arbitrary but authorised by
Caesar, as the words decreto Caesaris might seem to suggest. Or does
Cicero mean to imply by his language in ἓξ 40, 41 that Antony had
actually forged the will?

30 non habebat] cp. ἓ 62 l. 3ο.

quin] ‘nay more’.
32 cum sica] ‘armed with a dagger’‚ cp. note on ἕ 8 l. 7.
33 proficiscitur] towards the end of Β. C. 46.

P· 27. 1 prorogatis] ‘having allowed you a few additional days for pay-
ment', cp. ξ 241. 21.

3 rudem] se. accepisti or accepit, according as we suppose Antony
to have been personally addressed or not; the phrase rudem accipere
was a familiar one, and so the verb is omitted. Gladiators on their
release from the service of the arena received a wooden soil (rudis) as a
token of discharge. We might perhaps render in English, though the
metaphors are not parallel, “What‚ so good a prize—fighter throw up the
sponge so quickly ?’'
