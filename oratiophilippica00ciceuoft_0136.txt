108 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXXI 77

8 cisio] a light two-wheeled vehicle, ‘ gig ' ; see a figure of it in
SDA.
obvoluto] muffled in a sold of his toga, or paenula if he was wearing a
travelling cloak. In an ordinary way the Romans wore no head covering‚
at least at this period.
9 ianitor] the verb which the reader at once supplies mentally is
omitted for brevity, so in the next sentence confestim ad eam (sc. venit).

12 caput] ‘the chief point ', ‘the surn and substanceu’.

13 illim] ‘ from that quarter ’; cp. exim, istim : the word was gradually
superseded by illinc (zillz'm-i-ce).

¹4 transficclzsse] cp. Fam. IX. 14 ἓ 4 libentius omnis meas, si modo sunt
aliquae meae, laudis ad te transfuderim.

15 in collum invasit] Plut.‚ Ant. 10, says περιβαλών κατεφίλησεν ‘'threw
his arms round her neck and gave her a hearty kiss '. This, according
to the same author, was one of Antony’s attempts to make the masculine
Fulvia more genial (ἱλαρωτέραν).

16 nequam] ‘ abandoned ’.

19 metu] it is not clear how Antony’s sudden return could have caused
a prolonged panic unless it was that he spread the report to which

Plutarch vaguely refers (Ant. 10) that Caesar was dead and that the foe
were advancing on Italy.

‘zr tquz'orem] sc. caussam redeundi ε love was the plea that brought him
home, but outside of his own house (foris) a baser motive drew him to
Rome, viz. the desire to retain his ill-gotten possessions. Cicero adds
eliam, regarding Antony’s love for Fulvia as in itself turpis.

L. Plancus] L. Munatius Plancus, Caesar’s legate in Gaul in 54, and
doubtless acting as his agent on this occasion 3 he was brother of
T. Munatius Plancus, tribune at the time of the Clodian disturbances in
52. Fomyth, Life of Cicero, seems to confuse them. Plancus was one
of the eight praefecti urbis, πολιανόμοι, appointed by Caesar in 45 3 it is
inferred from this passage and from Fam. XIII. 29 that he filled the
office of praetor urbanus.

praedis tuos] ‘ your sureties ’ i.e. the property of your sureties 3 so we
speak of ‘selling up' a person, meaning his property. Cp. Att. XII. 18 A
opinor (Antonium) propter praedis suos accucurrisse.

22 productus in contionem] no private person could address a public
