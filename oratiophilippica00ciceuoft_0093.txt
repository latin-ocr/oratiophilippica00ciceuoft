was a time when the Gauls were superior to the Germans’, and with
the present passage cp. Cic. Mur. 25 inventus est scriba quidam...qui
cornicum oculos corfixerz't.

si potes] ‘if you can': Cicero might have written sz' possis ‘if you
were able'.

quinquenne] Pompey and Crassus as consuls in 55 proposed in the
lex Pompeia de provinciis that Caesar’s command in the two Gallic
provinces and Illyricum should be prolonged for 5 years, from 1 March
54 to 1 March 49. The original limit of his command was for 5 years

from 1 March 59 to 1 March 54. See Att. VIII. 3 ἓ 3 (written in 49)
where Cicero accumulates instances of Pompey’s weakness and vacilla-

tion at a critical period.

prorogaret] “‘to prolong Caesar's imperium for 5 years', lit. ‘to
propose a further 5 years’ imperium'; not ‘to extend his former 5 years’
imperium’: cp. ξ 74 paucis tibi prorogata& diebus i.e. ‘allowing you a
few days’ respite’ '’ (M).

ut absentis eius ratio haberetur] rationem habere absentis ‘to take
account of a person in his absence’ was a technical phrase of the
Roman constitution signifying to allow a person to stand for an office in
his absence, that is, to allow him to dispense with the obligation of
giving in his name in person at least three weeks (trz'nundinum) before
the date of election. Caesar wished to stand for the consulship of 48,
but his command in Gaul would not expire till March 49, and by
a previous law which had been nominally but not practically altered he
was entitled to retain his command till the arrival of his successor on
1 Jan. 48, which he was very anxious to do in order to escape impeach—
ment, to which he was liable when out of office. He would thus be
unable to give in his name before the date of election which would
probably take place in July 49. There was an old rule requiring
this personal declaration, and it was naturally of importance for Caesar
and his party that the obligation should be dispensed with, not only for
the reason above mentioned, but also because by entering the city for
the prqfessz'o he would forfeit his triumph: accordingly a special enact-
ment or privilegium granting this dispensation was carried by the ten
tribunes in 52, with the consent of Pompey; but in the lex Pompeia de
iure magistratuum, contemporaneous with the lex Pompeia deprwz‘ncz'zls·
mentioned above, the old rule was reaffirmed without any exception
being made in favour of Caesar who was thus again excluded. Suetonius
says (Caes. 28) that this was due to an oversight of Pompey's, per
