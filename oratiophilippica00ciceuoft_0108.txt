80 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [xv 39

14 si modo homines sunt] ‘if only they have any human feeling‘: cp.
the well-known line homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.
interdum] ‘allow themselves occasional mental relaxation '.

ἕω.

18 hereditatem] ‘you have denied that any inheritance comes to me’:
the taunt implies that Cicero’s contemporaries did not respect him
sufficiently to leave him anything in their wills. See M's note.

20 amplius sestertium ducentiens] 20, 000‚000 sesterces, nearly A17o‚000.
On the amount received by Cicero by inheritance cp. Prof. Tyrrell‚
Correspondence of Cicero 1. Introd. p. xxxviii. s011.; he regards the
statement in the text as a ‘rhetorical hyperbole’ ; Forsyth, Life of
Cicero p. 66 foll. It was no uncommon thing for wealthy Romans to
leave large bequests to their friends, and Cicero as a popular and
successful advocate was particularly fortunate in this respect.

21 acceptum rettulz] ‘ entered as received’ 3 cp. note on ἓ 12 end.

22 in hoc genere] ‘in such matters’3 lit. ‘in this class ’ of things3 the
defining genitive is very frequently omitted after genus.

23 ut] ‘so that’, ‘the result being that’: this seems to be the force of
the utin a disputed passage of Horace, Ep. 11. 2. 87 frater erat Romae
consulti rhetor, ut alter alterius sermone meros audiret honores ‘there
were two brothers at Rome, one a rhetorieian, the other a lawyer, the
result being that the one heard nothing but compliments from the mouth
of the other '. Ι believe the passage to be free from corruption, but see
Prof. Wilkins' note. Cp. below ξ 73 ut doleremus.

si quod erat] ‘whatever it was ’‚ ‘such as it was ’.

25 L. Rubrius] mentioned again in ἐξ 74, 103: nothing farther is known
of him.

Casinas] of Casinum, a town in Latium. Here was afterwards
founded the monastery of Monte Casino by St Benedict‚ A.D. 529 (M).

5²41.

26 albus aterne] ‘whether he was white or black’: a proverbial way of
speaking, implying that nothing is known of a person; see examples in
LS.‚ s. v. ‘albus’. Observe that the disjunctive formula ‘whether...0r'
is here expressed merely by the addition of the enclitic ne to the second
member of the disjunction3 this usage is rare, Draeger 112. 466 quotes

three other instances from Cicero.
