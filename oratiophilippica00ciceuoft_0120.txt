92 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [xxm 56 ³

restituit] not srom exile, otherwise the following remark quasi vera...
liceret would have no point, but to his full civic status, cp. below in
integrum restituit, from which it appears that infamia or loss of certain

political rights attended condemnation on a charge of gambling; see
SDA. alea.

p. 21. 1 sed ut] put brieflyqfor sed restituit ut ‘but he restored him in
order that’, &c. Antony cancelled his ‘debts of honour‘ by the restora-
tion of his creditor.

2 legis] a law permitting the restoration of the condemned: the phrase
beneficio legis, ‘thanks to' a particular law, is almost a technical one:
cp. sortium beneficio Caes. B. G. 1. 53, legis praemio Acad. 11. ἓ 1, Reid.

3 absentem credo] Cicero proceeds to give a list of imaginary reasons
sor Denticula’s restoration: credo marks the ironical supposition. To
institute a prosecution against a person in his absence, if he were absent
on public business, was contrary to the principles of Roman law: in the
case of a private individual sufficient time would be allowed him.

4 rem iudicatam] ‘that judgement was given without the accused being
heard in his own defence': the word indictus, the negative of dictus, is
chiefly used in this formula z'na'z'cta caussa.

5 nullum...iudz‘cium] ‘that the judgement conceming gambling was no
judgement by the terms of the statute’, i.e. was invalid. J. S.R.

7 corruptum] ‘invalidated'.

8 nilzz‘l] nz‘lzil may perhaps be here regarded as an adverbial accusative
‘in no respect’.

quoniam...est] ‘since the mere fact of his having been condemned
goes sor nothing’3 because an innocent man may be condemned.

10 infore alea ludere] an act of the highest indecorum, as we at Cam-
bridge might say ‘play cards in the senate house’: similar expressions
are Off. 111. 75 in foro, milzz· crede, saltaret, ἓ 90, Ι. 145 in soro cantet.

12 z‘s non...prc3fitetur] ‘does he not unblushingly (apertissime) declare
his own likings?'

557.

13 Hispaniam] Caesar set out for Spain in the spring of 49, leaving
Antony‚ who had entered 011 his tribuneship on 10 Dec. 50, to super-
intend his interests in Italy with the title of ‘propraetor’.

15 perag-ratio] a word that seems not to occur elsewhere, though the
verb peragrare is common: ‘how disgraceful was his style of travelling’.
