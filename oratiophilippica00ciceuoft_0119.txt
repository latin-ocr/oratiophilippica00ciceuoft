12 ἓ 1 cur non omnes fatum illius (Pompei) exsecuti sumus?

15 sugam] Cicero in his letters osten speaks of the exodus of the Porn-
peian party from Rome in the beginning of the year 49 as a shameful
ssight, though he here speaks as if they had been driven out by force of
arms, cp. Att. vn. 11§4; 12 ἓ 23 13 A§ 13 Dio XLI. 7 who says the
fugitives ἦσαν πάντες, ὡς εἰπεῖν, οὶ πρῶτοι καὶ τῆς βουλῆς καὶ τῆς ἱππάδος
καὶ προσέτι καὶ τοῦ ὁμίλου, Plut. Pomp. 613 Mommsen 1v. 392.

17 expulsam atque exterminatam] cp. Mil. 101 lzaec tanta virtus ex lzac
urbe expelletur exterminabitur proicietur: notice that Cicero here omits
the preposition ex before suis sedibus contrary to his usual custom.
Draeger 12. p. 515 qu. Cic. N. D. Ι. 63 urbe atque agro est exterminatus
as an isolated instance, overlooking this passage. [ex suis would very
likely get written essuis and then suzlv. J.S.R.]

while the republic was yet intact, had succeeded in preventing'.

his general course of wickedness ; this expresses the force of the tamen.

of law, so here Cicero refers to persons exiled or otherwise punished for
some offence3 cp. Sull. ἠ where innocentis is opposed to calamitosos.

patrui] C. Antonius Hybrida, Cicero’s colleague in the consulship,
cp. 98. He was charged with conspiracy and extortion and was sent
into exile. M. Antonius neglected to restore him in 49, the year of his
tribuneship, when his influence with Caesar would probably have
allowed of his doing so: he was finally restored by Caesar, probably in
47, and was present in the senate on 1 Jan. 44, cp. ἕ 99.

33 alea] gambling was forbidden by the laws, cp. Hor. Od. 111. 24. 58
