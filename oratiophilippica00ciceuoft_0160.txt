132 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XL 103

valeat] ‘hold good‘, ‘prevail': note that as sar as the word goes,
valeat might mean ‘good bye to', ‘I'll have nothing more to say to’, as
in N. D. 1. 124 deinde si maxime talis est deus ut nulla gratia nulla
hominum caritate teneatur valeat, but this would not suit the sense here:
for a curious instance of ambiguity cp. Att. lv. 5 ἓ 1 sed valeant recta
vera honesta consilia, where Ι think Prof. Tyrrell is right in explaining
valeant as ‘ prevail’.

2 tabulae] ‘bills of sale’.

modo Caesaris, non tuae] provided that they really are Caesar’s and
not your own fabrication.

quibus...liberavz‘stz] (provided that they are those) ‘by which you
have incurred debt‚ not those by which you have freed yourself from
debt'. Antony bought property at sales without paying for it; on the
other hand by getting possession of the treasures left by Caesar in the
temple of Ops he freed himself from his gaming and other debts: thus
tabulae is used in two senses, (i) ‘handbills of sale’‚ and so ‘auctions ’,
(ii) ‘ account books' of the money stored in the temple, and so denoting
the money itself.

6 z‘p5um] ‘of course it was too much trouble to wait for Caesar
himself! ’

ἓ 104.

9 quid? si etiam] ‘ again, what if Caesar even sent you written instruc-
tions to restore' (Varro's property)?

10 impudentia] your shamelessness in not restoring it.

12 aliam caussam esse] lit. ‘that there is one case of Caesar’s auction,
another of your ' ἃς. : translate more freely ‘ that Caesar's auction rests
on different grounds from your’ &Q ε that is, if Caesar chooses to sell
confiscated property (as he did Pompey's)‚ well and good, but your
audacity in seizing Varro's property is unjustifiable. ἱ

13 confidentiae et temeritatis] ‘your unabashed temerity’, ‘unblushing
audaeity ’ : confidentia is often used in a bad sense, as our ‘ confidence '
sometimes is.

14 procurator] ‘steward', ‘bailiff'; any one who ‘looks after' (procurat)
the affairs of another; the word is familiar in its abbreviated form of
‘ proctor '.

17 perbacchatus] the compound is apparently coined by Cicero: bacchari
is common.

ab hora tertia] from about 9 a.m.
