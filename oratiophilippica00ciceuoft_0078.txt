50 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [ΙΙΙ 7

§⁷.

24 Μ. Crasso] for the ill will between Crassus and Cicero cp. Plut.
Crass. 13. Cicero regarded him as implicated in the conspiracy of
Catiline‚ though Crassus appears to have given Cicero a friendly warn-
ing one night of the designs of the conspirators. The young P. Crassus
was however a firm friend of Cicero. Crassus generously spoke in
favour os Cicero’s consulship, Att. 1. 14 qui milti laudem illam eo minus
deberet quod meis omnibus litteris in Pompeiana laude perstrictus esset.
He is referred to in Att. Ι. 16 ἕ 5 in the words Calvum ex Nanneianis &c-
as bribing the judges in the trial of Milo. He inflamed Caesar against
Cicero, Fam. 1. 9 ξ 9; cp. Off. 1. 109, Sest. 39, Fam. XIV. 2, Q. Fr. 11.
3 ἐξ 3, 4. “Crassus was never hindered by any keen sense of honour
from pursuing his own advantage. He was a merchant and was open to
negotiation”‚ Momms. 1v. 344.

25 uno] used to strengthen the superlative nequissimo: cp. Plane. 97
urbem unam mz'lzz' amicissimam. The unam in ξ 84 should not be com-
pared with this, for rem unam is there opposed to multis rebus.

27 quantum] i.e. what a kindness I then did him in abstaim‘ng from
personal censure.

29 litteras] this letter, with Antony's answer to it, is still extant 3 see
Att. xlv. 13 A and B.

diceret] consecutive subjunctive, R. ξ 1680 foll.; Caesar B. G. 1. 39
quorum alius alz‘a causa illata, quam sz‘bz' ad proficiscendum necessariam
esse diceret, petebat ut διο. The subjunctive appears to be due to a
slight indefiniteness in the relative.

30 humanitatis] ‘kindly feeling’‚ ‘good feeling ’.

vitae communis] ‘the courtesy of daily life’ like vitae societatem
below.

31 qui paulum...nosset] ‘who had but a superficial acquaintance with
the mutual dealings of honourable men '. The subjunctive is restrictive,
cp. R. ξ 1692 : in such cases quidem is often added to the relative.

33 quid est...absentium] ‘what is this but to remove from life all its
kindly fellowship and to annul the intercourse of absent friends?' For
the form of expression quid est aliud tollere ‘what else is to remove’
where we should say ‘what is this but to remove’ cp. Phil. Ι. 22 quid est
aliud kartam· adulescentis ut turbulenti ...cives velint esse? an example of
the fuller form with nisi occurs in Sen. 6 quid est enim aliud gigantum
modo bellare cum Dz's nisi naturae repugnare? Though Cicero adopts
