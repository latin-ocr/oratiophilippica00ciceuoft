§3.

2. 2 amicitia] Antony seems to have been determined to break with
Cicero, who in his first speech had been careful to express his friendship
for Antony, cp. Phil. 1. 11 cuz· sum amicus, idque me non nullo eius
officio debere esse prae me semper tuli, and see the friendly letter of Cicero
to Antony in Att. XIV. 13 Β where in the words beneficio provocatus he
no doubt refers to the same service rendered him by Antony that is
hinted at in the above quoted words non nullo eius officio: see below
ἕ 5. It is worth remembering that Cicero had written his Laelius or
treatise on friendship during the summer of this year.

contra rem suam] the commentators say that this was some business
connected with Sicca, who is often mentioned in Cicero’s correspondence;
cp. Att. XVI. 11 written in November 44 where there is a reference to
this speech. What the affair was is not known, and the words nescio
quando ‘on some occasion or other' show that it was unimportant.

alienum] one unconnected with me, ‘a stranger’ 3 beware of transla-
tingit ‘alien'.

collectam] ‘won’‚ ‘acquired’z a common use of colligere.

iste] notice once for all that Cicero often addresses Antony directly as
tu, and at other times speaks of him indirectly as iste and once or
twice as hic: contrast this sentence with the next. This must be borne
in mind throughout the speech.

obtinuit] ‘maintained’. Cicero means that Antony was enabled
by some iniquitous intervention on his behalf to maintain the wrong,
whatever it was, that he had committed. intercessio was the regular
term for the ‘intervention’ of a tribune 3 whether such tribunicial
intervention is here meant must remain doubtful, owing to our ignorance
of the facts of the case: at any rate Antony was not upheld in his
wrong dealing by the ius praetorium, i.e. the law as embodied in the
praetor’s edicts. Each praetor laid down general rules of law which
were called edicta, and which gradually came to form a valuable addition
to the civil law of Rome. The expression implies that this was a
private suit as the office of the praetor was ius inter civis dicere. [HM. 's
statement that a tribune had no right to meddle with a private suit is
wrong. The case of Quinctius for instance was private, but a tribune
intersered, and such interference often took place. J.S.R.]

Q. Fadi] Q. Fadius Gallus (in Att. XVI. 11 ἓ 1 read Galli Fadz)
whose daughter Fadia was Antony’s first wife ; Phil. ΧΙΙΙ. 2 3.
