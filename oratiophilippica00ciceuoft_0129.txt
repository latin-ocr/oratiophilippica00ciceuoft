XXVIII 70] NOTES. 101

ς 69.

8 m'e quidem miseret] ‘for my own part I pity’.

10 quid nari...dz'sczplz·na] ‘what (conduct) that was not based on (did
not spring from) the highest morals and the strictest disciplineP’

13 institutis] ‘habits’.

pro...sunt] ‘bedrooms and dining-halls have become dens of infamy
and gluttony’.

15 frugi] ‘respectable' : esse frugi or bonae frugi was an old phrase
meaning ‘to be fruitful’, ‘serviceable’, ‘useful'; in course of time frugi
came to be regarded as an indeclinable adjective which could be attached
to any case of a noun, and took the place of the normal adjective sru-
galis, which is seldom found save in the comparative and superlative.
Another adjective of like anomalous character is nequam.

16 suas res sibi habere] the usual formula os divorce. Legal separation
between husband and wife was easily obtained in Rome at this period ;
nothing seems to have been required but a declaration, made in the
presence of witnesses, of intention to separate agreed to by both parties
and stating reasons; the words tuas res tibi habeto ‘take what belongs
to you’ no doubt formed a part of this declaration (cp. Gaius dig.
xxw. 2).

clavis ademit] ‘took from her the keys’. The woman was expected
to hand over to her husband the keys of the house or of such part of it
as was under her control; there must have been a provision to this
effect in the Twelve Tables, the great foundation code of all Roman law.
In the present case as Antony was not married to Cytheris, no formula
of divorce seems to have been necessary; they merely parted company.
This took place in 47.

17 exegit] the husband said exi or isoras or something similar: Bueche-
ler thinks the original phrase was baete foras. MM. Vn. 68—72.

porro] ‘forthwith’.

18 cuius...divortium] ‘in whose whole life no more honourable deed
can be found than his separation from an actress’.

19 at...nequissimus] “but how often he uses the phrase, Ἰ, a consul and

an Antony', which is the same as saying ‘ Ι, a consul and a profligate’ or
⁶1, a consul and a scoundrel’ ''-
