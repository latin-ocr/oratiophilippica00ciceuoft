ANAL YSJS. xix

before the civil war. ξ 24. Ι twice urged Pompey to thwart
Caesar, but my advice was always disregarded. I wished they
had either never formed or never broken their alliance.

§25 You say Ι counselled the murder of Caesar. The
suggestion is flattering but untrue. ἐξ 26, 27. If I had, my
name would have been talked of; besides, our glorious regicides
needed no urging from me. ξ 28. You say that Brutus, while
yet redhanded, called out my name ; no doubt because he ‚felt
he had rivalled my former exploits. ξ 29. Fool, do you not
see that to rejoice at the deed is as criminal as to counsel it?
In respect of their joy all good men are equally guilty with me.
ξ 30. You are so stupid as to compliment Brutus and abuse
me! And your judgement is as faulty as your language.
Decide whether these men were murderers or liberators.
ξ 31. They must be either criminals or patriots; you always
treat them with respect, as though you thought them patriots.
ξ 32. You aequit them of guilt and must therefore think them
worthy of honour. I will tell them never to deny that Ι had a
hand in this most glorious deed. ξ 33. The odium of the deed
is nothing compared to the glory. Happy men worthy of honour
in all times! ξ 34. If Ι had been one of them Ι should not have
spared you. But how do you defend your own conduct? You
were notoriously implicated in the plot, though the deed required
a truer man than you are. ξ 35. If you were asked to whom the
deed was profitable‚ you might well say to yourself. ξ 36. It has
saved you from ruin. However do not sear, no one is likely to ac-
cuse you of the deed. Now for your lesser charges against me.

ξ 37. You blame me for my conduct in Pompey's camp. Ι
confess I was despondent, not for my own life, but because
I saw the coming disasters. Would that my counsels had
been followed! ξ 38. Then Rome would have seen no more
of you. But you say I alienated Pompey. We disagreed‚ but
retained our friendship. ξ 39. Those who were with him in
his flight know what he thought of me. You charge me with
untimely joking, to which I need hardly reply. ξ 40. I must
have hit the mean, if you charge me first with gloom and then
with gaiety.
