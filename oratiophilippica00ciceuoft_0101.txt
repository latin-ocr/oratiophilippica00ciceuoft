hence ludis suis above: cp. Phil. x. 7, 8; according to Appian B. C.
111. 23 they were celebrated in his stead by C. Antonius, the brother of
Marcus.

incredibili honore] ablative of attendant circumstances.

16 provinciae] on 1 June Crete was assigned to Brutus, Cyrene to
Cassius, by the lex Antonia de permutatione provinciarum; previously
Macedonia had been destined by Caesar himself sor Brutus, Syria for
Cassius; and this had been confirmed by the senate on 18 March.

17 quaestores] a military quaestor accompanied each of the provincial
praetors ; his duties were mainly financial: as it was usual for provincial
governors to have quaestors there would be no point in Cicero's state-
ment of the fact that Brutus and Cassius had thern: he must mean that
they had more than the ordinary number, and this is implied by the
word additi.

legatorum] we do not know the number of these legati : apparently a
propraetor usually had one legate, MM. 11. 646 notes 1, 23 Caesar had
ten in Gaul, Pompey 24 (or 25?) in Asia. They were expected to be
generally useful to the provincial governor—quorum opera consilioque

in command of detachments of the provincial forces and sometimes
exercised jurisdiction.

atque] almost=atqui asin ἓ 1. Some editors prefer to read atqui.

18 homicidas] supply dicis eos esse as with parricidas above, l. 12, but

sequitur ut liberatores] if liberatores be accusative we must supply
dicas eos esse; but, if nominative, supply sint, unless indeed we should
actually read liberatores sint tuo, &c.; some MSS have sint after iudicio.

ἓ 32.

21 diiunctius] ‘somewhat disjunctively’, a logical term, cp.§ 18 diiuncta
atque contraria: there is nothing wrong or unusual in the use of the
comparative here. Translate freely ‘but perhaps you fail to understand
statements that are more or less mutually exclusive'. In Acad. 11. 97
Cicero gives aut eliam aut non ‘either yes or no’ as an instance of a
disjunctive statement.

22 conclusionis] another logical term, ‘a syllogism’, cp. Acad. 11. 40,
where an example of a conclusio is given: conclusionis is a kind of
