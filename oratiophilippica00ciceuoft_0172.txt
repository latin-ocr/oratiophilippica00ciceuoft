144 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XLV 116

expenditure as well as for the exhibitions and festivals which he
surnished at his own expense see Suet. Caes. 38, 39: yet he is said to
have reduced the number of recipients of grain at the public expense
from 320‚000 to 150‚000, Suet. Caes. 41. The stability of the Roman
state was seriously weakened by this pernicious habit of keeping the
mob in the capital in good temper by periodical largesses.

29 clementiae specie] species when thus used implies a salse show or
pretence, but Cicero well knew that Caesar's clemency was genuine and
invariable, even his enemies being agreed <as M. points out) that he was

remarkably indulgent to his opponents. Curio however before he
attached himself to Caesar agreed with Cicero, cp. Att. x. 4 ἓ 8 ipsum

autem non voluntate aut nalura non esse crudelem, sed quod popularem
putaret esse clementiam. See M .’s note. [The temple of Caesar as Iuppiter
Iulius was united with that of Clementia. J.S.R.] Cp. Plut. Caes. 57.

§ 117.

P. 42. 1 inusta] lit. ‘which were burnt into the state’: we should say
‘ with which the state was branded ’.

3 quantum cuique crederet] not ‘how much it trusted each ’‚ as one
might translate if one regarded the syntax alone without the sense, but
‘how much it should trust each': this subjunctive is classed by Roby

under the head of jussive subjunctives in dependent interrogative
sentences, ἓ 1612: contrast this with didicisse quam sit pulchrum in 1. 5,
for which see R. ἓ 1758 foll.

5 beneficio gratum] acceptable by the benefit it confers.
7 tulerint] for the mood cp. R. ἓ 1730.

ς 118.

8 occasionis tarditas] ‘the slowness of opportunity’: ‘nor will men
wait for the tardy arrival of the fitting moment ’.

11 quibus ortus sis] especially the grandfather, whom Cicero held in
esteem. Perhaps the preposition α should be inserted before quibus, cp.
Madvig on Fin. v. 69, Reid on Acad. 1. 3. The best MS is defective
here, having respice quaeso ali quibus ortus sis.

mecum] supply redi in gratiam.
