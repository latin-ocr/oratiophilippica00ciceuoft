been staying at Dyrrachium, whence shortly after the decisive battle he
returned to Brundisium.
4 non occidzktz] cp. ξ 5 l. 30, note.

§ 60.

8 patriae] objective genitive ‘affection for one’s country'.

1 1 sit] ‘because‚ as you remind me, it was not taken by you’; hence the
subjunctive; contrast the previous clause quod non ademisti ‘which (as a
fact) you did not take’.

licuitne] ‘did your insolent language suffer me to cherish this benefit
of yours as 1 did cherish it, and that too though you saw that you would
hear such words as these from me?' the meaning is that Antony by his
insolence had done his best to efface from Cicero's mind the recollection
of the service that he had done him. ‘praesertim cum refers to per tuas
contumeliam affronts which were the more wauton, as you knew that I
could retaliate'. HM.

12 tueri]= memori mente colere (Heusinger).

praesertim cum] ‘and that though ⁷, a very common meaning of the
words 3 for a good instance cp. Phil. VIII. 5 C. quidem Caesar non
exspectavit vestra decreta, praesertim cum illua⁷ esset aetatis. ‘ Caesar
did not wait for your decreeS, and that too though he was so young'.

ἓ 61.

19 tot dierum viam] this probably means that she travelled from Rome
to Brundisium to meet Antony; this would take from 13 to 15 days, the
distance being about 370 miles. See Prof. Palmer’s remarks on
Horace's well-known journey, Sat. 1. 5. 103.

qui non] Cicero might have written quin here and before viderit,
and also quin scierit, but wishing to negative the verb strongly, he
prefers qui non: the difference may be seen in English ‘who was there
but (quin) saw her? ², ‘who was there who did not (qui non) see her?'

indoluerit] indolesco was not much used in the Ciceronian period.

ς 62.

21 percursatio] a rare word, perhaps only found here and ξ 100.

22 deductio] deducere is regularly used of establishing a settlement, and.
deductio militum here signifies the establishment of armed garrisons in
the Italian towns.
