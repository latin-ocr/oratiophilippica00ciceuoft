tiara in the presence of the assembled multitude. Shouts of
applause rent the air when the invidious gift was rejected by
Caesar with outward alacrity if with inward reluctance. The
time had not yet come when a Roman could set a seal on the
servitude of his countrymen by assuming the title of king. That
attempts would sooner or later be made on the life of one in
Caesar's position, notwithstanding his invariable clemency to
his political opponents, must have been obvious to everyone.
A conspiracy was already being formed, in which the most
active members were Marcus and Decimus Brutus, C. Cassius,

been wild and undisciplined. If Cicero may be believed he was
deeply in debt at the age of 16. Nor were his domestic relations
calculated to improve his character. His uncle Gaius, Cicero’s
colleague in the consulship in 63, was suspected of favouring
the Catilinarian conspiracy and was afterwards banished for
having practised extortion in his province. His mother, after
his father's death, married P. Lentulus who took part in the
