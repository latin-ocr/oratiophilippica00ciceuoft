was therefore the great nephew of Julius. Though not mentioned
in the second Philippic he was already a prominent personage
as Julius' adopted son and heir. On learning the news of the
murder he crossed to Italy from Apollonia where he had been
completing his education and journeyed to Rome, having an
interview with Cicero on the way at Puteoli. He arrived in
Rome at the end of April. On the 9th of May he was introduced
by the tribune Tib. Canutius to a public assembly at which he
delivered a speech promising to carry out the testamentary
behests of his uncle who had left a large sum of money to be
divided among the Roman people. It was only natural that a
rupture should ensue sooner or later between him and Antony,
and we are told that a strong feeling of jealousy and suspicion
existed between them from the very first. During Antony's
journey to Brundisium in October Octavian made overtures and
grants of money to some of the military colonies established by
his uncle, and won over to his side two of the newly arrived
Macedonian legions, a course of proceeding which made it clear
to thoughtful observers that he had in view a war with Antony.
At the end of the year he opened negotiations with D. Brutus,
offering him aid against Antony. War was declared in January
43, and at the end of April Antony was totally defeated in the
battle of Mutina. The further course of the war lies beyond
the scope of the Philippic orations.
