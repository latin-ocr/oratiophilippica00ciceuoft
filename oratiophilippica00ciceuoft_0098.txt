70 ORA TI O PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XI 29

ἓ 29.

15 sit] ‘if, in your view, it is a crime’3 the subjunctive seems to show
that Cicero is expressing the thought of another and not speaking

directly in his own person, but it may possibly be explained as in ἓ 31
1. 7 where see note.

19 regnare] this and regnum are often used of despotic power.

20 boni] the well-intentioned party, the optimates with whom Cicero
was politically allied.

g 30.

2 3 stuporem] a stronger word than stultitia, cp. 80 incredibilem stupidi-

tatem lzomim's cognoscite.

pecudis] not quite the same as our insulting epithet ‘beast' which
would be belua (a word that Cicero is very fond of applying to his
enemies) but rather corresponding to our ‘blockhead ², implying dull
insensibility or stupidity 3 cp. Phil. V111. 9 lzomines agrestes, si homines
illi ac non pecudes potius, inani spe... provehuntur.

²4 honoris caussa] this was an apologetic expression used in reference to
a living person mentioned by the speaker 3 ‘Brutus, whose name Ι
mention with all possible respect’. A passage from Q. Rosc. Corn. 18
is worth quoting in illustration of this: nonne quotienscunque in caussa in

caussa appellasti? quod nemo nisi aut honestissimo aut amicissimo facere
consuevit. qua in re milzi ridicule es visus esse inconstans, qui eundem
et laederes et laudares, et virum optimum et hominem improbissimum esse
diceres. eundem tu et lionoris caussa appellabas et virum primarium esse
dicebas et socium fraudasse arguebas.

28 prae se tulit] prae se ferre is not often used of holding or carrying an
actual thing or person in front of one, being more often applied to the
open display of qualities or feelings, as prae se serre gaudium, tristitiam,
clementiam etc„ but cp. Suet. Calig. 19 prae se serens (in curru) Darium
puerum.

tulit] it should be remembered that tuli (tetuli) is strictly the perfect
of tollo but is borrowed by fero which has properly speaking no perfect
of its own: tollo uses forits perfect sustuli strictly a perfect of the rare
present sustollo, and the same perfect is also borrowed to serve as the
perfect of suffero. The original stem of tollo, viz. TAL becomes by an
easy and not uncommon change of sound TLA, whence the participle
