XLVl 119] NOTES. 145

12 redi] we should begin this clause with ⁴ but at any rate ', but in Latin
the abruptness caused by the omission of the adversative particle adds
vividness to the style.

13 ⁶ videris] ‘butas to your own course of action you will see to that’:
videris is future perfect, see Roby pref. vol. 2, p. ci.—cvii.

ego de me ipse prefitebor] ‘I will speak for myself’: ipse is to our
notions somewhat redundant; notice that de me ipso would suit the
English idiom better, but the other form is usual in Latin.

14 adulescens] cp. note on ξ 113 1. 21.

15 obtulerim] beware of regarding this as an apodosis to si...p0test:
obtulerim is probably to be regarded as an apodosis to a suppressed
protasis such as si necesse ficerit, and si ...potest is a kind of independent
clause added afterwards: the whole sentence if expanded would run
thus ‘I should offer (lit. ‘ I should be found to have offered' perfect)
my life willingly‚ if need should arise, in case the liberty of the state'
&c.‚ cp. R. ς 1536, 1540 ; crediderim, dixerim ἃς. are often so used,
cp. ἓ 2 5 1. 9 citius dixerim.

16 repraesentam] properly ‘to present again ’, ‘to re-present’: the word
is often used in mercantile transactions in the sense of ‘ to pay back at
once ’‚ ‘to pay ready money’ : Cicero is fond of using it metaphorically:
translate here ‘if my death can ensure an early recovery of the liberty of
the state ’.

g 119.

18 abhinc] ‘from the present time'‚ ‘ago’: with this word the accusative
marking duration of time is used in preference to the ablative, cp. R.
ἓ 1092, and for apparent exceptions cp.§ 1091: [the passages where
the ablative is given in MSS of authors before Gellius hardly amount
to half a dozen, which fact is sufficient to condemn the usage altogether.
The difference between annis and annos to our MSS writers was nothing.
J.S.R.]

19 templo] of Concord. Cicero refers to the fourth speech against
Catiline ; the first was delivered in the temple of Jupiter Stator, the
second and third were contiones.

negavi] cp. Cat. IV. ἓ 3 nam neque turpis mors forti viro potest
accidere neque immatura consulari neque misera sapienti.

22 adeptus sum.. amum ut] these words, which are omitted in the oldest
