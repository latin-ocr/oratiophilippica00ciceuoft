II septemviratu] a commission of seven persons appointed by Antony
and his brother Lucius to parcel out certain lands in Italy among his
partisans. References to it are found in various passages of the
Philippics, cf. V. 7, VI. 44, VIII. 26, XI. 13, XII. 20, 23. Five of the
commissioners are known, the two brothers Marcus and Lucius Antonius,
Dolabella, Nucula and Lento, leaving two unknown (Halm’s Introd.:
note 1693 Lange 1112. 503 misinterprets Cic. Att. XV. 19 ξ 2). The
uncle C. Antonius was first proposed as a member and then ‘left in the
lurch ’ by his nephew (destituisti).

12 intervenit] ‘ for a person intervened whom, I suppose, you were
afraid you could not refuse without peril to yourself '. Madvig, quoted
by M., says this was either Nucula or Lento.

14 debebas] notice that the apodosis to the protasis si...esset is virtually
contained in the infinitive colere, and when such is the case it is usual to
put the auxiliary verb (debeo, possum, oportet Sec.) in the indicative, which
‘ conveys a positive expression of duty, possibility, right &c.' R. ἐξ 1564,
1 566.

15 filiam] Antonia.

sororem] ‘cousin ’, in full soror patruelis, but the adjective is dropped
when the context prevents any possibility of mistake‚ so fraterzcousin
in Att. I. 5 ξ 13 LS. Wrongly says that this usage is post-Augustan.
The word consobrinus, from which comes our ‘ cousin ', is properly the
child of a mother's sister, but was used generally of all cousins-german.
Antony seems to have divorced his cousin for the sake of Fulvia.

19 sedente patruo] this shows that C. Antonius had been recalled from
exile, probably by Caesar, before 44, though his nephew had refused to
recall him in 48, cp. ἓ 56.

20 stuprum] as Drumann remarks Antony would hardly have advanced
t'he charge of adulter-y in a full senate had there not been some ground
sor it, though Cicero calls Antonia pudicissima femina.

21 interpretari] for interpretari with dependent interrogative clause in
sense of ‘ decide ', LS. only quote Liv. I. 23 neque, recte an perperam,
interpretem cp. Att. XV. 26 ἓ 2 quod quale tibi videretur ut posses
interpretari.

mentally supplied after senatu, Dolabellam, and audiente. It was
