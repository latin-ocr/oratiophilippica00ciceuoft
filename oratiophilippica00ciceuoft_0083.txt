V 12] NOTES. 55

C. Figulo] C. Marcius Figulus, cos. in 13.c. 64 with L. Iulius Caesar a
relative of the great Julius.

26 0.,8ίίαηο, L. Murenae] D. Iunius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena
were the consuls of 62, and were therefore as Cicero says consules
designati in 63. The former gave it as his opinion that the Catilina·
rian conspirators should be put to death. Murena was accused of
bribery in his candidature for the consulship and was successfully
defended by Cicero 'm a speech still extant.

27 M. Catom] hitherto Cicero had been speaking of exconsuls; he now
mentions one who never held the office of consul, M. Porcius Cato,
a rigid Stoie, who not choosing to survive the defeat of his party
committed suicide at Utica shortly after the battle of Thapsus B.C. 46.
Cicero wrote a treatise in praise of him called ‘laus Catonz's', to which
Caesar replied with an ‘Anticato’. Cato approved highly of Cicero's
policy during his consulship but refused to vote in favour of his having
a supplicatio decreed in his honour, for which Cicero thought him
ungrateful. See the correspondence between them in Fam. xv. 3—6.

qui...vz‘dit] cum...tum= ‘both...and’: hence translate literally ‘who
both exercised forethought (providit) in many (other) things by quitting
life, and also in the fact that (quod) he did not see you consul ². Cicero
says ironically that Cato showed great foresight in dying as he did, and
so avoiding‚ among other calamities, the sight of Antony holding the
consulship. For the construction cp. leg. Agr. 11. 91 multum in poste-
rum provzderunt quod. . ,urbem ipsam solutam ac debilitatam reliquerunt.

30 decedens ex Syria] this was early in the year 62 but he did not enter
Rome till the autumn of 61. In a letter to Pompey written during the
course of the year 62, Fam. v. 7, and elsewhere, Cicero complains that
Pompey had not adequately appreciated his great services to his country.

31 visurum] ‘he should see’ when he entered Rome, that being in the
strict sense his patria. Cicero met him outside Rome when he was
waiting for his triumph.

32 quid...c0mmem0r0] ‘why do Ι mention’: quid commemorem, which
Cicero might have written, would be ‘why should Ι mention’: cp. Cat.
IV. 15 quid ego equites Romanos commemorem ? and directly after (ξ 16)
quid ego hosce homines ordinesque commemoro ‚⁹

p. 6. 2 referret acceptam] referre acceptum is a book-keeping phrase ‘to
set down as received ', ‘to enter on the credit side of one's accounts': the
expression is often used metaphorically‚ as it is here; e.g. tibi vztam
meam acceptam refero means ‘I place my life to your credit'‚ i. e. in the
