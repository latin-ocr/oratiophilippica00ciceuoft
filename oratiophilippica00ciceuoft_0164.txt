136 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XLII 108

ἓ 108.

qut] cp. ἓ 76 qui vero Narbone reditus.

19 Cinnam] in B.C. 87 Cinna, deprived of his consulship and banished
from Rome, joined forces with Marius and besieged Rome. They
entered the city and ‘ devastated it with slaughter and rapine ’, Liv.
Epit. 80. Cicero was then 20 years old.

’.νο Sullam] Sulla's supremacy lasted from 82 to 793 the proscription
took place in 82, in 80 Cicero defended Sex. Roscius of Ameria, who
was one of Sulla's victims. This was the first caussa publica in which
he engaged.

21 absconditi] Cicero is surely grossly exaggerating in representing
Antony as making a greater show of violence than Cinna or Sulla.

22 nec ita multz] this use of z'ta witffa negative and qualifying an adjec-
tive or adverb seems to be chiefly Ciceronian: we should say ‘not so
many after all': cp. Phil. Ι. 7 nec ita multum provectus reiectus austro
sum, ‘and when I had not gone so very far after all, I was driven back
by a southerly gale’.

23 secuntur] the subject is indefinite, ‘men follow'. Cicero compares
Antony's armed followers to an army marching in a compact body with
the baggage in the centre, a disposition adopted in traversing a hostile
country, or when a sudden attack was feared.

scutorum lecticas] ‘litterssul of shields’, a curious use of the genitive
of sort or material, R. ξ 1304.

‘24 lzis inveteratis] ablative absolute: ‘these practices have now become
chronic and we have been hardened to them by use'.

2 5 cum] slightly concessive, hence the mood.

26 metu perterritz] ‘panic-stricken' : cp. Phil. 1. 6 consules designati nega-
bant se audere in senatum venire, patriae liberatores urbe carebant, &c.
Cicero adds that he himself preferred hearing of the doings at Rome to
seeing them, and so kept away. In the beginning of June he was at his
Tusculan villa.

g 109.

27 qui] ‘as one who djd not need a senate': qui=cum is in causa]
sense.

28 neque] the neque correlates with the que after statim: the Greeks and
Romans sometimes say ‘neither...and’, an idiom which is foreign to us;
‘ he neither missed anyone. . .ana⁷ immediately performed those marvellous
