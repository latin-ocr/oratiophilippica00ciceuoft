72 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XII 31

plan or act, ‘circumspect’, ‘thoughtsul’. Our word ‘considerate’ de·
noting a kindly regard for the feelings of others is not parallel with the
Latin.
si parricidas] supply esse, ‘if (you say) that they are parricides’.
HM. are hardly right in translating quid dicis ‘what do you call
them?’; it should be ‘what do you say <that they are)?’ Some MSS
have parricidae, which may be right3 in that case supply sunt and trans-
late ‘ what do you say? If they are parricides’‚ &c-
12 honoris caussa] see note on ξ 30 1. 24 and the passage there quoted.
in lzoc ordine] in the senate ; apud populum Romanum in the con-
tiones or speeches addressed to the Roman people in public assembly.

14 referente te] ‘on your proposition’ : referre ad senatum, to lay a pro-
posal before the senate.

legibus est solutus] ‘was freed from legal obligation', ‘absolved from
the laws': the phrase legibus solvere is used of exemption from the
operation of a particular law, not of course of all laws.

si ab urbe] M. Brutus was praetor urbanus in 44, and as such was not
allowed to quit the city for more than ten days at a time. This restric-
tion was probably arranged by the Licinian law of 367 B-C. when the
urban praetorship was formally constituted. Brutus seems to have left
Rome in April, cp. Att. XIV. 7, but it would appear from Att. xv. 9
that formal leave of absence was first given him on the 5 June ; in that
case the permission to disregard the law must have been retrospective.
Cassius was praetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit or briefly praetor pere-
grinus, and though his office was called an urbana provincia yet he was
not strictly the praetor urbanus and was not bound to limit himself to
ten days' absence from Rome. MM. 11. 179 n. 5.

15 ludi Apollinares] these games were first instituted B-Q. 212 as a
means of propitiating Apollo and gaining his aid against the Carthagi-
nians Liv. xxv. 123 in B.C. 208 the date of celebration was fixed on
13 July (reading ia'us for nonas in Liv. XXVII. 23): subsequently their
duration was extended, and at this time they seem to have lasted from ²
6 to 13 July. MM. v1. 480. They were presided over by the praetor
urbanus, thus affording an exception to the rule that the celebration of
games was one of the duties of the aediles.

incredibili M. Bruti honore] cp. Phil. 1. 36 qui ludis suis ita caruit,
ut in illo apparatissimo spectaculo studium populus Romanus tribueret
absenti, desiderium liberatoris sui perpetuo plausu et clamore leniret.
Brutus as praetor urbanus ought to have celebrated the games in person,
