genitive cp. ἕ 71 cuius dictatoris magister equitum fuisses.

25 constitueretur] the statement that Caesar was ignorant of the ap-
pointment of Antony can hardly be correct. The Master of Horse was
usually appointed by the dictator and chosen from magistrates of
praetorian rank, cp. Dio XLII. 21 τὸν ’Λντώνιον ἵππαρχον προσελόμενος
μηδὲ ἐστρατηγηκότα (thou gh he had not been στρατηγός = praetor), from
which we learn that Caesar made an exception to this rule in his
appointment of Antony. Another exceptional circumstance in this
case was that Caesar’s dictatorship, and consequently Antony's office too,
was to last sor one year from Oct. 48 to Oct. 47, instead of the six
months hitherto assigned as the outside lirnit for the dictatorship.
Plut. Ant. 8 says (Καῖσαρ) δικτάτωρ ἀναγορευθεὶς αὐτὸς μὲν ἐδίωκε
Πομπήιον, ’Λντώνιον δὲ ἵππαρχον ἑλόμενος εἰς Ῥώμην ἔπεμψεν, which must
be wrong, because it was after Pompey's death that Caesar was made
dictator.

26 Iizppz'a] Hippias and Sergius were actors. Antony felt that as
ἵππαρχος he was justified in his intimacy with Hippias—a poor jest on
the name. Juvenal VI. 82 seems to have been misled by the form
szppia into thinking that a woman was meant, as he gives the names
Sergiolus and Hippia to two probably fictitious characters, male and
female, of his own day.

equos vectzgalz's] a difficult passage. Halm's explanation (ed. 6) is
that theoretically the state had to furnish the horses required for certain
public games (curules equi), but that private individuals, and from the
time of Augustus, senators, were allowed to contract with the state sor
the supply, paying the state a fixed sum and reimbursing themselves,
with more or less profit, from the persons responsible for the games. In
this transaction he thinks that Antony was only ‘the man of straw’ and
that Sergius, who had no right to be so, was the real contractor and
received the profits. See Asconius on Cic. Or. in toga cand. p. 83,
Dio LV. 10, Liv. XXIV. 18. According to this view equos vectzgralz's is
equivalent to redemptionem equorum vectzgalz'um. Dr Reid however
doubts whether more is meant than that Antony let out horses for hire.
He regards it as inconceivable that equi vectzgrales could be a regular
name for the equi curules, in the sense of ‘horses supplied by contract'.
