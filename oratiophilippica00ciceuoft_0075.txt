Q. Hortensius—and one was then elected by the votes of the tribes.
After this followed the inauguration. MM. 11. 27 foll.

coniessisse] this implies that Antony had, according to his own
account, retired in favour of Cicero.

21 solvendo eras] in solvendo esse ‘to be (suited) for paying’ i. e.-‘to be
solvent’ the dative is classed by Roby under the head of ‘datives of
work contemplated’, R. ᾖ 1156, 1382 b. Cp. such phrases as esse esui
‘to be (fit) for eating’.

22 incolumem] Sest. 18 eamque (provinciam) nisi adeptus esset se in-
columem nullo modo fore arbitrabatur, where incolumis is similarly used
of a person who has not been injured by an adverse verdict in a court
of law3 cp. Plane. 12 incolumem a calamitate iudici.

de vi] apparently some followers of Curio were charged with rioting
at the election.

28 malm] ‘I preferred to confess myself under an obligation to you
rather than to be thought not sufficiently grateful by anyone not quite
acquainted with the circumstances’ (minus prudentz). He means ‘I
was not really bound to be so grateful, but for the sake of appearances
I felt it right to profess gratitude'. Of course prudenti is the dative
after videri, not after gratus.

30 Brundisiz] after the battle of Pharsalus, 9 Aug. 48, Cicero returned
from Epirus to Brundisium, whereas most of Pompey's adherents fied
to Africa. Here Antony showed him a letter from Caesar forbidding
any of the Pompeians to return to Italy without his consent. Cicero
replied that in his case such permission had already been granted by
Caesar through Cicero’s son-in-law Dolabella. On hearing this Antony
issued an edict specially excepting Cicero and Laelius. Cicero adds,
that he would rather Antony had tacitly excepted him without thus
