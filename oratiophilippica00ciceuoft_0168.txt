140 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XLIII 110'

The confusion seems to be caused by the twofold mention of an
additional day, (i) a day was added to the ludi Romani, an annual
festival ; (ii) a day was added to all supplicationes, which were testivals
os uncertain occurrence. [It is hard to see how Antony avoided the
contaminatio of the pulvinaria by abandoning the extra day at the ludi
Romani. The pulvinar was decreed to Caesar generally, and would
appear not merely on the particular day, but whenever there were ludi
Circenses, for the pompa was certainly not confined to the ludi Romani.
Again the pompa opened the games and did not close them. Therefore
even if Antony abandoned the fifth day, Caesar's pulvinar must have
already appeared at the opening ceremony. Perhaps it was intended

that there should be some very special celebration of the pompa in
Caesar’s honour on the fifth day. J.S.R.]

g 111.

26 te...mett‘rz] ‘that you make your own profit and not his dignity the
standard of all your actions ’.

27 quid ad lzaec tandem] supply respondebis, which is expressed after-
wards, when the thread of the sentence is pieked up again after the
parenthesis.

29 apertiorem] ‘still more open'‚ with a sly reference to the extreme
‘openness' of Antony's dress on the particular occasion mentioned in
the next sentence.

30 simplicis] ‘straightforward', ‘simpleminded'z there was no conceal-
ment or duplicity about you, argues Cicero ; you showed us your breast
as well as your thoughts with equal openness. N otice the artful use of
the phrase pectus videre, which in reference to simplicis might mean ‘to
see your inmost thoughts’ (cp. Am. 97 in qua (amicitia) nisi, ut dicitur,
apertum pectus videas tuumque ostendas, nihil fidum...lzabeas) and is
also intended literally in the sense of ‘to see your bared breast’.

31 hiscere] ‘to open your mouth’: generally used in a negative or
quasi-negative sentence3 only here in Cicero.

ς 112.

p, 40. 3 defende] ‘defend’ this day, that is, defend your conduct on
this day.
