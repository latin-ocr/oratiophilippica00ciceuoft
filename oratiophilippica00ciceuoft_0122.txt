28 municipia] originally communities of persons who were not full bur·
gesses of Rome but possessed most of the rights of citizens except the
ius szffragi and honoris (suffrage and holding office). But at this time
they were practically on the same footing as the coloniae. They were
governed by four magistrates constituting a collegium, of whom two were
called quattuorviri iuri dicundo and the other two quattuorviri aediles.
MM. lv. 479.

praefecturas] towns governed by a praefectus iuri dicundo sent
annually from Rome by the praetor urbanus.

colonias] more fully coloniae civium Romanorum, colonies of Roman
citizens with full burgess rights. They were governed by two commis·

felix esse nullo pacto potest. Cp. belom ἓ 64.

33 veteranis] Cicero naturally did not wish to say anything to injure the
veterans who had fought on Caesar’s side. It was enough that the
leaders should suffer. The argument of the whole sentence, which at
first sight is a little obscure, is ‘1 don’t want you to make me ill friends
m‘th the veterans whose interests Ι wish to have secured, and so I won’t
say anything about the character of the war you engaged in—though
aster all, their case is very different from yours—they followed their
