88 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XX 50

31 si lzoc est explere] ‘if that is glutting yourself‚ (appropriating) a thing
only to fling it away again directly’. A verb has no doubt been
lost after explere 3 Faernus followed by HM. supplies haurire, Dr
Reid suggests sorbere, others eripffe or corripere.

32 tribunatum] Antony entered on his office as tribune 10 Dec. 50, on
the 231d he delivered a speech containing a violent tirade against
Pompey, cp. Att. VII. 8 ἓ 5 habebamus autem z‘n manibus Antoni
contionem habitam X. Kal. Ianuar„ in qua erat accusatio Pompei usque
a toga pura.

33 viri tui] Curio, whom Suetonius calls violentissimus tribunorum,
Caes. 29.

p. 19. 2 domesticum ch’cus] ‘the decency of private life ’.

3 id est] ‘or rather’‚ used correctively, for which see Reid on
Acad. 1. 5.

4 fecerit] M. suggests fecit: had Cicero put the verb at the end of the
first clause directly after intemperanter the definiteness of the words ea
quae ‘those things which' would probably have led him to write fecit,
but as the sentence goes on this precision vanishes and acczjoite...quae...
fecerit becomes equivalent to ‘ Ι will tell you what he has done’, in a
sentence of which kind the subjunctive would be usual: cp. Att. VII.
13 ἓ 3 qui sermo fuerit et quid actum sit scribam ad te.

g 51.

6 [ἰαί. Ian.] B. C. 49.

8 C. Caesari] it was on this day that Curio handed to the new consuls
Caesar's letter, wherein he offered to disband his army if Pompey would
likewise disband his. Many thought that Caesar's overtures should be
accepted, but the senate overawed by Pompey and his troops finally
decided that Caesar should be compelled to give way. Caes. B. C. 1—6‚
Momms. IV. 376.

9 emancipatum] cp. Hor. Epod. IX. 9 emancipatus feminae, Reid on
Cic. Sen. ξ 38. Translate ‘sold and enslaved to Caesar' ; in ἓ 52
Cicero speaks of Antony's vendita atque addicta sententia.

10 cervices] the singular cervix does not occur in Cicero.
securi] the decree mentioned in the next sentence.
12 id decrevit] the form of the decree was dent operam consules praetores
tribuni plebis quique pro consulibus sint ad urbem ne quid res publica
detrimenti capiat Caes. B. C. 1. 5 and 7. This took place on 7 Jan. 49.
