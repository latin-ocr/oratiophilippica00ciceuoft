of Gabinius when he expelled the eques Lamia stom Rome was grossly
unconstitutional. Cicero represents Antony as boasting that he had
dealt with these persons as though they were not entitled to be regarded
as citizens. J.S.R.]

4 affari atque appetere] ‘welcome and court’: for the idea cp. Mil.
105 o terram illam beatam quae liunc virum exceperit.

5 quz]=ut is, cp. Fam. XVI. 12 ἓ 4 bellum paratum est, eiusmodi tamen
quod sustinere ille non possit where quod: ut id.

7 quae vero] vero introduces the last member os a series of interroga-
tions, as denique osten does.

ξ 34.

ιο non probes] ‘not approve ἰ Cicero uses this in preference to improbes
‘disapprove' because it expresses the opposite of approval rather more
forcibly: cp. non inimice below, 1. 19.

si fuissem] the context easily suggests some such addition as ex eo
numero or illorum socius.

12 stilus] this means properly a sharp pointed instrument (for stig-lus
‘a sticker’) and usually denotes an instrument for writing on wax
tablets, ‘a pen', but it seems to have been occasionally used of a
dagger, and Cicero here puns on the two senses. M. quotes Hor. Sat.
11. 1. 39 sed lzz‘c stilus haud petet ultro Ι quemquam animantem et me
veluti custodiet ensis Ι vagina tectus, where the commentators refer to
Cic. Cluent. 123 ne censorium stilum cuius mucronem multis remediis
maiores nostri rettuderunt aeque posthac atque illum dictatorium gladium
pertimescamus. It is curious that this meaning should not be noticed
in LS.

13 actum] cp. Hor. A. P. 189 neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu
Ι fabula quae posci volt et spectanda reponi, where see Wilkins’ note.
Cicero regarded three as the normal number of acts in a play, Q. F. 1.
1 ξ 16.

15 est] contrast§ 29 si ...voluisse interfici Caesarem crimen sit; in the
present passage the clause is not intended by the writer to be any way
subordinate, hence he uses the indicative.

16 Narbone] Narbo Martius, Narbonne, founded by L. Licinius Crassus
in 118.

Trebonio] cp. above, ἓ 17. This took place at the time of Caesar's
return from Spain in July or August 45 (Fischer).
