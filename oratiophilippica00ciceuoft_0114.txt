86 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XIX 48

afterwards married. At the end of 58, fearing to be implicated in
the downfall of Clodius and pressed by his creditors‚ he proceeded
to Greece but was invited thence by Gabinius, the proconsul of Syria,
who gave him a command. Plut. Ant. 2, 3.

4 iter Alexandream] it is not clear whether iter is nominative or accu-
sative, that is, whether the suppressed verb is erat or fecit3 the
question is immaterial, and possibly Cicero himself had not the dis·
tinction clearly present to his mind when writing. Alexandream is the
accusative after the idea of ‘motion towards' implied by iter, cp.
Pacuvius X. (22) 173 (Ribbeck Trag. fragm.), nam solus Danais hic
domum itionem dedit, so too Cic. Div. 1. 68, and Caes. B. G. 1. 5
domum reditionis, It was apparently in 55 that Antony went to
Alexandria.

contra senatus auctoritatem] Ptolemy Auletes had been forced by
popular discontent to quit his kingdom and had to come to Rome,
where proposals were made that he should be restored by force of arms,
but the senate refused to aid him. At last Ptolemy tried to induce
Gabinius, who was in Syria, by an enormous bribe to espouse his cause3
Antony anxious to distinguish himself joined his entreaties, and Gabinius
then consented, καίτοι τῶνῬωμαίων τὴν ἐπικουρίαν ἀπεψηφισμένων says
Dio XXXIX 553 the law too forbade provincial governors to quit their
provinces or undertake war without special authorisation, Dio XXXIX.
56. But Gabinius no doubt acted under the direction of the triumvirs,
Pompey‚ Crassus and Caesar. Momms. IV. 159 foll.

5 religiones] according to the superstitious Dio the Sibyl forbade the
restoration of Ptolemy, and the Gods showed their displeasure after the
event by a great inundation of the Tiber: cp. Fam. 1. 1 and 2 where
Cicero speaks of the religious objection (νείιζξίο).

6 quicum... posset] the precise shade of meaning intended is not clear,
but the general sense is evident‚ that Cicero considered them both bad
characters and well suited to each other. The year after this Cicero
defended Gabinius on a charge of extortion.

posset] consecutive subjunctive in relative clause.

7 qui...reditus?] cp. 76 qui vero Narbone reditus?

Galliam] Antony not venturing to return home hastened to Caesar in
northern Gaul after the second expedition to Britain, towards the end
of 54. The verb redz’z't or something similar may be easily supplied.

tum] before the confiscations (HM .).

ιο domum dz'c0?] cp. note on g 2 5 l. 9.
