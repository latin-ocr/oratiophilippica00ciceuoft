XXX 7 5] NOTES. 105

qut] the antecedent to qui is of course hunc, not qumquam.
4 id est] for this use of id est introducing an explanation or amplifica·
tion of a previous phrase cp. note on§ 50 l. 3.

ἓ 75.

6 aliquando tandem] this, or tandem aliquando, is a common phrase in
Cicero.

7 pervenire] he only reached Narbo, as we read later on.

8 Dolabella] P. Cornelius Dolabella was third (?) husband to Tullia,
Cicero's daughter. It is not quite certain that she was ever married to
Crassipes, Plut. Cic. 41, Boot on Cic. Att. IV. 5 ἕ 3.

ista caussa] ‘the cause (of Caesar) that you had espoused ' (ista).
10 ter] at Pharsalus, Thapsus and Munda.
13 nollem] supply adfuisset.
consilium] ‘ though his policy in the first instance was reprehensible
(i.e. his policy in espousing the cause of Caesar) yet his constaney was
praiseworthy ’.

14 quid es ξ’] ⁶ what are you? ’ i. e. ‘ what is to be said of you Ρ ’ Garatoni
quotes Fam. V. 12 ἓ 6 neque enim tu z's es qui quid sis nescias, Att. 111.
15 ἓ 2 quid enim sum ? Har. Resp. 42 lcz'c vero quid est? compare the
phrase aliquid esse ‘to be something': and for many instances of quid:
qualis with videri (as in Fam. IX. 21 ἓ 1 quid tibi videor z'n epistulis ?)
see Reid on Acad. ΙΙ. 76.

liberi] Gnaeus and Sextus.

15 tum primum] ‘ then, in the first place ἐ “primum does not belong

to tum, but is correlative of praeterea ” HM.

suerit] ‘granted that this (the recovery of their country) was the com·
mon cause of that party’ (the Pompeian party) ε yet, Cicero goes on to
say, they had special objects in view as well ; they wanted to recover their
own hearth and home of which you had robbed them ; cp. note on ἓ 62
1. 27.

18 etse] this concessive clause anticipates the word aequissimum which
suggests its insertion: Cicero’s meaning is—it was in the highest degree
right for you, in the circumstances, to fight against the young Pompeys,
yet how can one talk of right in a cause that is absolutely wrong (in
rebus iniquissimis) ?
