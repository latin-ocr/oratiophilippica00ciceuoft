XXXJI 81] NOTES. 111

and by magistrates, while spectio (observation) is used in particular of
the right possessed by the magistrates of enquiring the will of the gods
on any definite issue affecting their own proceedings and receiving an
answer to their enquiry. The general rules regulating such observations
were laid down by the leges Aelia et Fufia about 160 B.c. But in 58 the
tribune Clodius, among other measures, carried a law enacting ne auspicia
valerent, ne quis obnuntiaret, ne quis leg-i intercederet, ut omnibus fastis
diebus legem ferri liceret, ut lex Aelia lex Fufia ne valerent3 Sest. 33.
In consequence of this the magistrates no longer possessed the right of
nuntiatio and could not therefore hinder proceedings at elections. This
is shown by Festus nuntiatio, quia omne ius sacrorum habent, auguribus
competit...at his (magistratibus) spectio sine nuntiatione data est, ut ipsi
auspicio rem gererent, non ut alios impedirent nuntiando. Now when
Cicero says nos nuntiationem solum habemus: consules et reliqui mag-225-
tratus etiam spectionem he implies by the word etiam that the magistrates
have nuntiatio as well as spectio. This apparent discrepancy is due to
the fact that for his own purpose he is ignoring the Clodian law and
treating the leges Aelia et Fufia as unrepealed and still in force 3 yet
below he says neque licet (de caelo servare) comitiis per leges, thus contra-
dicting himself by assuming *the validity of the Clodian law. If this
explanation be correct we are in a position to see that Antony’s
proceedings were not due to stupidity, as Cicero alleges, but to his
observance of the Clodian law. [I am not satisfied that Cicero is wrong.
The facts were too notorious for him to run counter to them : no doubt
obnuntiatio (which is not the same as nuntiatio) and servare de caelo
were abolished by Clodius (though afterwards magistrates occasionally
treated his law as invalid and apparently with success) so far as legislative
comitia are concerned‚ but is there any proof that he did so in respect of
the elective comitia? I think all the passages relating to the operative
effect of the Clodian law concern legislati0n3 while many passages (Q. F.
111. 3 ξ 2, Phil. 11. 599) seem to show that obnuntiatio remained for elec·
tions. If comitia in ἓ 80 be interpreted as referring to electoral comitia (a
sense often found in the letters) everything is made smooth. It may be
that the peculiar form of obnuntiatio denoted by servare de caelo, which
implied a previous announcement, was entirely abolished. J.S.R.]
