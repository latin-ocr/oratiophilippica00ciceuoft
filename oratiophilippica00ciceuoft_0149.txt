XXXVI 91] NOTES. 121

ἓ 91.

tua] ‘yours was that fine panegyric'. Antony began with a
laudation of Caesar’s acts and character, and then seeing the populace
aroused‚ so worked on their feelings that excited beyond control they
burnt the corpse on the spot, using for fuel anything that came in their
way, Suet. Caes. 84. The house of L. Bellienus, a senator who lived
near, was burned to the ground, whether by accident or design does not
clearly appear.

2 5 miseratio] a term of rhetoric3 ‘ pathetic appeal’, ‘burst of pathos'.

26 semustulatus] the i of semi is elided before the vowel as in semuncia
and (sometimes) semanimus or semanimis. See Att. XIV. 10 ille etiam
in foro combustus laudatusque miserabiliter servique et egentes in tecta
nostra cum facibus immissi.

28 quos] ‘which' ; the antecedent being probably impetus and not
servorum. >

30 quasi fuligine abstersa] ‘when you had, if Ι may say so, washed the
soot from your face'; that is, by way of purging yourself of your evil
deeds on the day of the funeral you passed all those fine laws, cp.
Seneca Ep. 94 opifices intuere...videbzs quanta fidigine oblinantur3
Plaut. Poen. V. 4. 2 3 os oblitum est ficlzgine; and for abstergere Poen. V.
2. 9 creta est profecto haec horum hominum oratio, ut milti absterserunt
omnem sorditudinem. The primary reference is of course to the smoke
raised by the burning of Caesar. J.S. R.

31 ne qua] cp. Phil. 1. 3 adsentiri etiam nos Ser. Sulpicio clarissimo
viro voluit ne qua tabula post idus Martias ullius decreti Caesaris aut
benefici figeretur3 from which it appears that the motion was proposed
by Sulpicius and that Antony spoke in favour of it. 'Cicero thought
that these measures though good in themselves were not binding on the
people as having been passed without due regard to the forms of laW,
hence he proposed that they should be reenacted‚ Phil. V. 10.

3² tabula] tablet on which the decree was written: these tablets were
hung up or affixed in some public place (cp. ξ 92 toto Capitolio tabulae
figebantur) and were subsequently placed in the tabularium ‘registry'
or ‘record office'.

benefici] probably refers to the granting of the rights of citizenship,
cp. ἓ 92, where after mention of immunitates, grants of freedom from
certain public burdens, Cicero says civitas non iam singillatim sed
provinciis totis dabatur.
