xxigvm 97] NOTES. 125

6 gynaeceo] there is inten tional sarcasm in the use of the Greek word.
In the Roman house there was no separate sitting room for women,
both men and women alike using the atrium: the old-fashioned Roman
of Cicero's day felt a great contempt for Greek ways and habits.

8 meditere censeo] probably ut should be mentally supplied with the
subjunctive, though some regard the censeo in sentences of this kind as
parenthetic, and the subjunctive as used in a jussive sense.

ἓ 96.

12 quibus] dative of the indirect object R. ἓ 1132 foll.; it is a kind

of ‘dativus incommodi'.
iure consultus] the same form occurs Mur. 273 it is usually iuris
consultus.

13 iste] Manutius suggests that this is Sextus Clodius, Antony’s teacher
of rhetoric.

14 dicet preferred by Orelli and read by Halm (ed. 6) in place of
the dz‘cz‘t of the mss.

16 suum sz‘bz'] sibi serves to strengthen the possessive suum3 logically
the pronoun should be ez· as the subject of the nearer verb venderes is
Antony, though Deiotarus is the subject of the principal verb possedit:
cp. Plaut. Trin. 156 nunc, sz' ille huc salvos revenit, reddam suom sibi
quoted by R. ξ 2265, see also R. ἕ ¹143 who says ‘this use of sibi
is only in Plautus, Columella, Terence Ad. 958, with an echo in
Cic. Phil. 11. 96 and perhaps in Am. ἓ 11’. [This last instance, sibi
suo tempore, is of a different nature. J.S.R.]

venderes] the force of the subjunctive with prius quam may be
rendered by translating ‘without waiting for you to sell him what was
his own ’.

ξ 97.

19 commentariis] ‘ memoranda ἐ chirographis ‘ autograph notes’.

20 imitatores] cp. an exactly parallel passage in N. D. 111. 74 id quoque
L. Alenus fecit cum chirographum sexprz‘nzorum imitatus est: there were
people who ‘imitated'‚ that is, forged, memoranda purporting to be
Caesar’s and made money by selling them. The reading institores
adopted by Orelli and HM. aster Pantagathus has no authority.

21 gladiatorum libellos] handbills, sold in the streets, announcing
approaching eombats of gladiators with the names of the combatants.
