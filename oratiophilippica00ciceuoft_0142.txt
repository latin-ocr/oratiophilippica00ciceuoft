1 14 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXXIII 82

centuries of equites Ramnenses, Titienses and Lucerenses, which, when
the patricians were doubled‚ became six centuries, but were generally
styled sex suffragia; but, as Lange points out, there is nothing whatever
to show that the six originally patrician centuries voted at a different
time from the η centuries that owed their origin to the so-called Servian
constitution: [if the sex suffragia did not vote separately‚ it is hard to
understand why they continued to be marked off from the 12, which
must have formed part of the prima classis of the reformed constitution.
On the whole I should be inclined to leave the text alone and interpret
suffugia as sex suffragia, but the question is too involved to argue
briefly. 1f there is nothing to prove that the sex suffragia voted
separately, there is also nothing to disprove it. J.S.R.]

g 83.

C. Laelium] Antony is so scrupulous that you might fancy him a
second Laelius: C. Laelius the chief interlocutor in the dialogue de
amicitia was consul B. C. 140 and was a member of the augural college.
He was a man of the highest character and gained the title of
‘Sapiens'.

diceres] the second person is quite indefinite and corresponds to our
‘one’: translate ‘one would say that he was C. Laelius’ not ‘one would
call him C. Laelius '. For this hypothetical subjunctive cp. R. ἓ 1544,
who quotes Verr. 11. 4. 31 quo posteaquam venerunt, mirandum in
modum—canis venaticos diceres—ita odorabantur omnia, &c-

alio die] this was the formula used by the augur when on the occur-
rence of an unsavourable sign he forbade the magistrate to proceed with
the election: if no adverse sign appeared his words were silentium esse
videtur in answer to the question dicito si silentium esse videbitur:
another question was dicito si aves addicant, answer aves addicunt.
MM. VI. 388.

de caelo servasse] notice servasse not servare: the observation of the
unfavourable sign had to precede the electi0n‚ cp. ἓ 81 1. 23.

obvenit] ‘came in the way': ‘ob’ in composition often denotes ob-
struction, cp. obesse, officere, obicere, obnuntiare, &c.

iam Kal. Ian.] ‘as early as the first of January’.

provideras] notice provideo but praedic03 cp. note on ἓ ²4·

hercule] perhaps the vocative of an older form Hei-culus, afterwards
confused with the Greek Her-acles.
