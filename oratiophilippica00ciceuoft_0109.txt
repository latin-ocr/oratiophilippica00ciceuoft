xv1042] NOTES. 81

27 Q. Fufi] supply filium: nothing is known of him. Rubrius passed
over his nephew and the son of Fufius, both of whom had superior
claims to his property, in favour of Antony.

28 sui] genitive after amicissimi ‘a very great friend of himself '-or as
we should say, ‘of his own '.

quem..factitarat] ‘whom in public he had always given out as
his heir’.

29 nominat] very probably Cicero wrote nominavit, cp. praeteriit and
ficit. J.S.R.

30 nisi molestum est] for the indicative, cp. ἓ 24 1. 2ο ea velim reprehen-
das, si potes. The phrase is a formula of mock politeness, cp. Acad. Ι.
14 (Reid); ‘is I am not troubling you too much '.

31 J.. Turselius] an unknown person, mentioned again in ἓ 103.

Ρ. 16. 2 tamquam] this and tamquam si are used indifferently; cp.§
106 tamquam si esset (consul).

542.

3 admiratus sum] ‘I was surprised ‘: even in modern English the word
‘admire’ is sometimes used in this sense, as by Dickens, “Mrs Chick
admires that Edith should be by nature such a perfect Dombey’'.

4 hereditatum] this and hereditatium appear to be admissible forms
of the genitive.

5 patris] cp. the speech concocted by Dio Cassius XLV. 18—47 τοιγα-
ροῦν τῶν μὲν ἐκείνου χρημάτων οὐκ ἐκληρονόμησεν, ἄλλων δὲ δὴ καὶ πάνυ
πολλοὺς, τοὺς μὲν μήτ’ ἰδὼν μήτ’ ἀκούσας πώποτε, τοὺς δὲ καὶ νῦν ἔτι
ζῶντας (47); cp. XLVI. 14. Antony's father was far too generous for
the small means at his disposal and had to be kept in check by his more
frugal wife, Plut. Ant. 1.

non adisses] adire hereditatem is the usual phrase for ‘to enter on’ or
‘take possession of an inheritance'. [non adisses hereditatem ‘refused
to accept the inheritance' absolutely implies that Antony was made heir
by his father. But the hereditas being damnosa, the liabilities being
more than the assets, Antony declined, thus fixing on his father the
stigma of bankruptcy. Roman feeling required that every sacrifice
should be made by the heir to avem: this disgrace—see an interesting
letter of Pliny 11. 4. Cicero only means to imply that Antony was dead
to the ordinary sentiment about family honour; he showed it too by
what is mentioned in ἓ 44. J.S.R.]
