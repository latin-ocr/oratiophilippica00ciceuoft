rectioris, In some cases I have added his notes in
whole or in substance with his initials appended‚ in
others Ι have modified my notes in accordance with
his views without any special mention of the fact. I
also owe a great deal, as all students of Latin do, to
Dr Reid's editions of various works of Cicero.

I have written a short introduction to the speech,
giving a very brief sketch of the chief events of the
period, which may be useful for reference, and I have

one or two exceptions‚ that of Orelli, Baiter and Halm,
18563 but I have tried to improve the spelling, taking
as my chief guide Brambach's Hiilfsbijchlein fiir
Lateinische Rechtschreibung (ed. 3, 1884).
