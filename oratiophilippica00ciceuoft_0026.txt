xxii ANAL YSIS.

You met Caesar on his return from Spain and curried favour
again, ξ 79. securing the consulship and trying to oust
Dolabella. ξ 8ο. Though Caesar had promised the office to
Dolabella you said that as augur you would vitiate the election.
ξ 81. You could have done it equally well as consul, but
you are as ignorant as you are shameless. ξ 82. How abject
you were when in office* When the day for Dolabella's election
came, the proceedings went on as usual; ξ 83. when suddenly
you interposed‚ seigning some unfavourable sign. But I must

traffic in grants and privileges, doing your best to ruin the
state. ἓ 93. You seized the public treasure and paid your debts
with it. You and your friends sold decreeS, one in particular about
Deiotarus, g 94 who was a bitter foe to Caesar, yet now receives
from you a grant purporting to have been made him by Caesar.
ξ 95, 96. The wording of it betrays it. You and Fulvia drew up
the bond, which even your lawyer will tell you is of little avail‚
for Deiotarus recovered his possessions for himself after Caesar's
death, instead of waiting to purchase them from you. ξ 97.
You forged innumerable documents, one, both mischievous
and absurd, about Crete. ξ 98. You restored exiles, excluding
