XXXI 77] NOTES. 107

on the right shoulder. Augustus forbade the wearing of it in Rome
Suet. Aug. 4o; under the Empire it seems to have superseded the
sagum as the military dress ; cp. SDA. lacerna, MM. vn2. 568.

29 adspicis me] a rhetorical touch to give vividness to the speech, cp.

ἓ 361· 33·
ne] cp. ξ 3 L 14.

33 sutis-se viderere] ‘ fancied that you had been ’ ς said with bitter irony,
because Cicero chose to think Antony's appointment irregular. He was
master of horse from Oct. 48 to Oct. 47. qui=cum tu.

proximum annum] the present year 44.

P. 28. 1 peteres] this was the proper word to express constitutional
candidature for an office: it is implied that Antony begged for the
office (rogares) rather than offered himself as a candidate in the ordinary
way. The word may imply, as rogabatur below, that permission to
hold the office had now to be begged from the great man of the day,
namely Caesar3 cp. ἕ 79 iussus es renuntiari consul.

Galliae] Cisalpine Gaul.

a qua] as petere means ‘to solicit ’ it is here followed by a with the
ablative of the person (here represented by qua, the country for the
people) from whom the favour is sought. Orelli reads e, remarking
‘e qua' sic dictum est ut illud ‘ex provincia triumphare ’, so ΗΜ.,
translating ‘for our services in which' (as propraetors, quaestors
δια).

ς 77.

6 Saxa rubra] some rocks of red tufa about nine miles from Rome on
the left hand side of the via Flaminia; the place is now called Grotta
Rossa. Here was fought in Oct. A. D. 312 the decisive battle between
Constantine and Maxentius that made the former master of the Western
Empire.

cauponula] the diminutive is contemptuous: ‘some wretched little
tavern '.

7 perpotavit] ‘prolonged his potations'.

ad vesperam] the accusative with aa' is the only part of vespera used by
Cicero, and perhaps only here and Cat. 11. 6. The usual form is ad
vesperum. Dr Reid doubts whether the MSS are to be trusted in
these two passages, inasmuch as vespera is an archaic and poetic word,
afterwards reintroduced into prose by Sallust and his imitators.
