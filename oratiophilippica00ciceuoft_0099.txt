XII 31] NOTES. 71

tlatus or by the dropping of the t, another easy vocal change, latus.
Beginners, if capable of surprise at any os the anomalies of grammar,
must often wonder at the confusion in this class of verbs.

31 consul] ‘in your position of consul': i.e. as supreme magistrate of
the state it is fitting that you should pronounce an authoritative decision

on the conduct of these men.
32 reliquorum] we say ‘and of the rest’: in such enumerations the

Romans always omit the copula.
quam velis esse caussam] ‘what you decide their case to be’, i-e.

‘what view you take of their case’.

edormi crapulam...exlzala] cp. Plaut. Rud. 586 edormiscam hanc cra-
pulam, and for exhala, cp. below, ξ 42 vini exhalandi and Verr. 11. 3,
28 nondum. . ,crapulam exhalassent.

33 faces] apparently an allusion to some trick of waking a person from a
comatose condition by applying a brand. On the Continent worn-out

horses are still sometimes started on a journey by the application of fire.

P. 12. 4 cogitationem..suscipe] ‘address yourself for a moment to the

dinate to oratio obliqua confiteor eos...esse, Kennedy§ 190. The same
explanation may possibly apply to the subjunctive sit in ἓ 29 1. 15.

9 parricidas] parricide was regarded by the Romans as a crime almost
too heinous to be possible: cp. Rosc. Am. ἓ 62 quae (sceleris vestzgia)
nisi multa et manifi’sta sunt, profecto res tam scelesta, tam atrox, tam
uffarz'a credi non potest, and ἓ 70 where Cicero relates a tradition that
Solon enacted no law against it because the possibility of such a crime
never occurred to him.

10 si quidem] ‘if indeed': si quidem sometimes means ‘since' but that
would not make such good sense here. The murderers of Caesar are
often called parricides, and Suetonius Caes. 88 says that it was proposed
to call the ides of March parricidium ‘the day of parricide'.

suum] ‘one’s own'3 referring to a general subject.

11 sapiens et considerate] the same epithets are quoted by LS. from
Pliny Pan. 44 ἓ 5 consideratus ac sapiens: consideratus is properly ‘well
considered', used of plans or actions, then transferred to the persons who
