106 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXX 76

ς 76.

21 convomeres] a rare word ‘ bevomit’.

23 Narbone reditus] the addition of the preposition is more usual when
the place ‘from which' is dependent on a substantive, cp. Phil. IV. 3
a Brundisio reditum ; R. ξ 1259: cp. ἓ 64 Alexandrea se recepit,
Phil. 111. 8 ex eis quidam Roma recentes, ‘newly come from Rome ’. For
the form of expression cp. ἓ 48 qui tum inde reditus aut qualis ?

quaerebat] no doubt in his speech on 19 Sept.

ex ipso cursu] the ipso can best be expressed by translating ‘ when 1
was actually on my journey ’ ε Cicero is perhaps quoting Antony's words,
which may have been cur tu ex ipso cursu tuo tam subito revertisti? ‘ from
the very middle of your journey ' : somewhat similar is ἓ 93 qui in ipso
dolore risum posset continere, ‘ in the midst of his indignation’.

'²4 revertissent] Caesar returned suddenly to Rome 31 Aug„ abandoning
his projected journey to Greece. Note that reverti not reversus sum is
the correct perfect of revertor. The participle reversus however occurs
Phil. VI. 10, Caes. B.G. VI. 42.

nuper] in the first Philippic delivered on 2 Sept-3 cp. Phil. 1. 7—10.

26 Kal. Ianuarias] cp. Phil. 1. 6 ea mente discessi ut adessem Kalendis
Ianuariis quod initium senatus cogendi fore videbatur. He had promised
to return by that date, when his friends Hirtius and Pansa would enter
on their consulship3 Plut. Cic. 43 (M.).

27 tenebris] prose writers generally say in tenebris, though in phrases of
everyday occurrence such as ‘ by day ’‚ ‘ by night ', etc. the preposition
was dispensed with, die, luce, nocte, hieme, etc.: here usage is influenced
by sound, luce non in tenebris would not sound well.

28 cum calceis] cum is used with articles of clothing as well as with
names of weapons cp. ἓ 8. calceus was the ordinary Roman boot or
shoe (something like an ‘ Oxford’ shoe) as distinguished from the solea
‘sandal’ ; so toga was the distinctive Roman garment3 Cicero contrasts
his own homely attire with the foreign sashions affected by Antony.

Gallicis] a kind of sandal, Aul. Gell. XIII. 21 ξ 6. Different kinds
of Gallicae were sold at Rome, viriles rusticanae bisoles, viriles monosoles,
cursoriae.

lacerna] a light mantle of elegant shape and made of any colour that
might suit the taste of the wearer. It was worn over the toga, whence
Juvenal Ix. 29 calls it munimentum togae3 it was fastened by a buckle
