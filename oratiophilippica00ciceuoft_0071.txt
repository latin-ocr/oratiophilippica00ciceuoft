NOTES.

§L

P· 1. 1 patres conscripti] a traditional method of addressing the senate,
the origin of which has been much disputed. The most reasonable
view seems to be that of XVillems (senat de la Republique Romaine 1.
37—42), that the words mean ‘enrolled patricians’, that is, patricians
whose names were entered on the senatorial register, as opposed to
other patricians who were not members of the senate. Plebeians were
probably not admitted to the senate till about 400 Β. C.

2 his annis vzgz'ntz] ablative of time in the course of which something
happens 3 R. ἕ 1182: in Greek the genitive would be used, εἴκοσιν
ἐτῶν. Cicero, reckoning from the beginning of his consulship in 63,
is thinking chiefly of Catiline and his fellow conspirators whose rising
he had suppressed in that year, of P. Clodius the turbulent tribune
slain in a riot on the Appian road 18 Jan. 52, and no doubt of Caesar
himself: cp. Cat. lv. 22, Suu. 28.

5 optarem] stronger than vellem: opto is often used of extravagant 01·
visionary desires3 it is contrasted with spero in Fam. V. 8 ξ 2 sed exstitzt
tempus optatum mihi magis quam speratum3 Balb. §93 and in many
other passages.

6 imitere] notice that Cicero prefers this form of the znd person 111 the
present subjunctive and in the imperfect indicative and subjunctive.
Instances are numerous in this speech.

exitus] Catiline was killed in battle B.c. 62, when the force sent
against him was commanded by M. Antony’s uncle, the consul C.
Antonius3 his fellow conspirators Lentulus, Cethegus, Gabinius, Sta-
tilius were executed3 P. Clodius was killed in a fracas ; and lastly
Julius Caesar was assassinated 15 March 44.
