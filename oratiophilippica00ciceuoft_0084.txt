account between us 1 acknowledge that I stand indebted to you for my
life: cp. 40, 55, Att. XI. 1 ἓ 2, and often in Cicero.

ς 13.

4 qui duo] we should say ‘of whom two ’-

5 reliqui sunt] ‘ are left ²: reliquos almost=relictus‚ as eximius is
sometimes used in sense of exemptus Div. Caec. 52: cp. Cluent. 22 eum
filium quem tamen unum ex multis fortuna reliquom esse voluisset, in
which passage we may compare the words unum ex multis with Horace’s
una de multis face nuptiali digna Carm. 111. 11, 33 and with Cicero in
this passage duo de consularium numero, from which it appears that
de or ex may be used indifferently in such phrases, though ex is the more
common. See Holden on Off. 111. 34 quicquam...de eis, who cp. Mil. 65
ab uno de illis.

L. Cotta] see note on ξ 2 l. 17. L. Aurelius Cotta was consul in 65
with T. Manlius Torquatus. In 64 he filled the office of censor, though
according to Plutarch he was φιλοινότατος. In 57 when the consul
P. Lentulus Spinther brought forward a motion granting Cicero permis·
sion to return from exile, Cotta who was princeps senatus being asked*
his opinion said that as Cicero had not been legally banished no law was
necessary for his recall. Sest. 73, dom. 68.

ingenio] ablative of quality.

6 , rebus eis gestis] ‘ when I had performed those exploits'.

7 supplicationem] ‘a public thanksgiving’: the duration of these thanks-
givings varied3 this one was probably for five days; cp. prov. cons. 27,
Halm 011 Cat. 111. 15 (ed. Wilkins).

9 qui...neminz] cp. Cat. 111. 15 supplicatio dis immortalibus pro singu-
lari eorum merito meo nomine decreta est, quod milti primum post hanc
urbem conditam togato contigit, et his verbis decreta est ‘quod urbem
incendiis, caede civis, Italiam bello liberasscm'.

10 togato]=‘in time of peace’: lit. ‘clad in the toga ’‚ which was the
garb of peace, as distinguished from the sagum which was worn in
war, hence such expressions as saga sumere, aa' saga ire Phil. V. 31,
XIV. 1.

nemini] notice the emphatic position of this word: Caesar says with
equal pride and emphasis, B. G. 11. 3 5 diorum quindecim supplicatio
decreta est, quod ante id tempus accidit nulli.
