v11 17] NOTES. 59

o miser implies something like 0 quam miser es3 eontrast this with ξ 54
0 miserum te si haec intellegis, where the idea in the writer's mind is ‘how
wretched must we suppose you to be’ or something similar: in ἓ 89
auguria and in ἕ 104 tecta are probably nominatives: for other exx. see
ἐξ 4, 15, 58, 63, 68, 83, 86, 1003 and with the form of the present passage,
cp. 110 ο detestabilem hominem sive quod tyranni sacerdos es sive quod

mortui.
4 adulescens] Antony was about 20 at the time of the Catilinarian con

spiracy.
qui...memim'sset] i.e. who remembered hjs duty as a citizen.
5 cum...esset] cum must be slightly causal, hence the subjunctive ;
otherwise one might have expected erat.
6 nomen] the meaning is ‘who did not give in his name as a volunteer
for the protection of the senate?'

ἓ 17.

9 cmzsciomcm] the Allobrogian envoys who gave information of the pro-

posals the compirators had made to them ; in other ways too the con-
spiracy oozed out, as was natural considering the numbers implicated.

sua manu] cp. Cat. 111. 10 cognovit (Statilius) et segnum et manum
suam.

voce paene litterarum] paene qualifies the boldness of the metaphor.
Cicero refers to the intercepted dispatches addressed to the Allobrogian
envoys and found on their persons when they were arrested on the
Mulvian bridge. The writers were Cethegus, Statilius and Lentulus:

Cat. 111. 10.
1 1 quis esset] ‘who would there be ’‚ not ‘who was there'‚ which would

require erat.

12 ducem] Cicero is here referring to himself.

14 si qui] it is hard to establish any clear distinction between the use of
quis and of qui in such expressions as this 3 perhaps qui is more adjecti-

val than quis.
accidit contigisset] contingere is more often used of good than of bad
fortune, while accidere is far more often used of bad than of good: the
present passage and Cat· 1. 16 si lzoc (to be received with a dead silence)
post hominum memoriam contzgit nemini (with many others, ep. Reid on
Am. ἓ 8) give exceptions in the use of contingere, while Att. Ι. 5 omnia
quae iucunda accidere possunt accidebant and Caes. B. G. Ι. 30, lv. 22
afford instances of exception in the use of acczdere.
15 ad sepulturam] Plutarch Ant. 2 says emphatically that the corpses
