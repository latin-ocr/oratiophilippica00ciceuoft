regard him as a second despot. By these laws, some of which
are referred to in the course of this speech, he abolished the

office of dictator, distributed certain lands to the veteratis,
altered the constitution of the criminal courts‚ restored from
exile some notorious offenders, made a change in the tenure of
provincial governments‚ and altered the assignment of those

in favour of the proposed amnesty. But the popular revulsion
of feeling after the funeral of Caesar warned him that Rome
was not a fit place for patriots‚ and accordingly at the end of
April he started on a long projected visit to Greece. He reached
