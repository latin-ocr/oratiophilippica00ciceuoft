120 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXXV 89

13 aedem Ielluris] the senate was summoned here by Antony; cp.
Dio XLIV. 22, who gives the substance of the speech then delivered by

Cicero (23—33). Antony chose this place because it was near his house
in the Carinae, a district said to have been so named because the houses
were built round the temple in the shape of ‘ keels ’-

ς 90.

15 subito exstz'tz‘stz] on Sept. 1, when Antony, finding that Cicero who
had returned to Rome only the day before was not present in the senate
house, threatened that if he did not come he would have his house
pulled down, Phil. Ι. 12, v. 19.

16 tibi invideris] ‘you have been jealous of yourself’. Cicero says
sarcastically that Antony by his sudden change of policy has shown
that he was jealous of his own high reputation that he gained on
17 March by advocating the amnesty proposed by Cicero.

18 illius diei mentem] ‘your mind of that day ’, i.e. the views you
expressed on that day.

19 puerum] Antony's infant child, who, with the young son of Lepidus,
was sent as a hostage to the conspirators in the capitol. On receiving

these pledges of security they ventured to leave their retreat. The
child. who could not have been more than 18 months old, as Antony
was not married to Fulvia till 46, is called the grandson of Μ. Bambalio,
who was his mother Fulvia’s father, cp. 111. 16 homo nullo numero, He
was named M. Antonius but was sometimes called Antyllus. His life
was a short one, for he was executed by Octavian in 30 though already
betrothed to Octavian’s daughter Julia. Suet. Aug. 17 ; Drumann
1. 519.

20 quamquam] ‘and yet it was sear, no lasting teacher of duty, that
made you good ’.

22 audacia] note that audax, audacia are always used in a more or less
bad sense, like our ‘ audacity ’.

23 si illud funus suit] Caesar's funeral, or more strictly speaking his
cremati0n‚ was conducted amid such turbulence that Cicero hesitates
whether to call it a funeral, cp. Phil. 1. 5 qui illam insepultam sepulturam
ffcerant.

24 sceleratissime] quoted also from Sest. 131: there is some trace here
of a reading sceleratissimi agreeing with tyranni.
