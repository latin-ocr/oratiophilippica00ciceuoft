XXIX 73] NOTES. 103

quaest‘or etc. you had been’. The usual precision and perspicuity of
Cicero's style seems wanting in the text in its present form: if it be
right the construction must be de pecunia [eius] cuius tu, &c. ‘you were
called on for payment in respect of the money belonging to him whose
quaestor'‚ &c. Halm however (ed. 6) allows the omission of ab eo.

9 pro sectione] for the property you bought at the sale of Pompey's
effects.

ἓ 72.

10 videar] supply dicere.

12 pecuniam] supply some such word as petat or postulet ‘What‚ Caesar
demand money from me?' Draeger 12. 200 contrary to sense supplies
accepit. M. supplies petet, but perhaps the subjunctive ‘of indignation ’
(cp. note on ξ 15 1. 22) should be preferred.

13 at] ‘why, it was beyond his power ! '

ad illum...attuli] ‘I put within his reach’.

14 leges] this appears to be exaggeration on Cicero's part3 HM. refer
to Antony's enactments during his tribuneship mentioned in ξ 56, but,
as Abrami remarks, these were not of sufficient importance to warrant
the introduction of them here among the other measures of Antony that
served to introduce the civil war. More to the point is the reference to
Dio XLI. 17 (HM. introducti0n‚ note 42), from which it is gathered
that Antony proposed on behalf of Caesar the appropriation of the
sacred treasure and introduced other measures in his master's interest.

19 ius postulabas] ‘you made a just demand'3 for ius-:quod iustum est
cp. Plaut. Pseud. 1313 ius petis, fateor. Cicero is here replying to
Antony's imaginary demand ‘your demand was a just one, but what
good was it? Caesar was the stronger'.

ς ¹73.

20 excussis] ‘flung aside’: the metaphor is from shaking or wresting a
thing from a person's grasp: cp. Mur. 30 omnia ista nobis studia de
manibus excutiuntur, Sull. 24 excutient tibi istam verborum iactationem,
47 noli aculeos orationis meae excussos arbitrari.

21 cum]==‘whereupon': “the coincidence in time is sometimes vividly
expressed by an inversi0n3 what would otherwise have been the tem-
poral clause being put first as an independent sentence (often with iam),
and what would have been the principal sentence being subjoined with
cum, osten cum repente, cum interim, &c.’' R. ξ 17 33.
