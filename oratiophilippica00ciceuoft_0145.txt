xxxiv 86] NOTES. 117

callegam] colleagueship implies equality of rights3 Antony wanted
to make his colleague his master.

2 idem temptares] idem is masculine, agreeing with tu: not only did
you want to make Caesar your master, but you also (idem) tried the
endurance of the Roman people.

ferre et pati] the two words are frequently united by all authors;
such pairs of words are not infrequent in Latin: somewhat similar to
this is the phrase patienter ferre Phil. XII. 7, and elsewhere.

ς 86.

5 peteres] hardly :petere debebas (HM), but peteres is the apodosis to a
suppressed protasis3 if expressed in full Cicero’s thought would have
been something like this si servire velles (voluisses), tibi uni servitium
peteres (petisses) ‘if you wanted (had wanted) servitude, you would seek
(have sought) it for yourself alone ’: see Reid on Sull. 25.

omnia paterere] ‘ endure any indignity’ ; a reference to his sub-
servience to his friend Curio. Dr Reid suggests that the words ut
facile servires read like a marginal explanation of ut omnia paterere
that has crept into the text.

6 id certe]=†00†6 ’γε : ‘that office at any rate (viz. of giving Caesar the
crown) you did not have entrusted (mandatum) to you by us': beware
of taking id mandatum together as=‘that commission '.

8 nudus] the Luperci wore only a girdle about the loins, διαθέουσιν ἐν
περιζώματι γυμνοί, Cp. Phil. 111. 12 quo ille die populo Romano inspectante
nudus unctus ebrius est contionatus, XIII. 31 neque illius diei memoriam
perhorrescit quo ausus est obrutus vino unguentis oblitus nudus gementem
populum Romanum ad servantem cohortari ‚9

contionatus] contionari to address a public assembly: contio denotes
(i) an assembly gathered only to hear speeehes, not to vote on any
measure, (ii) a speech addressed to such an assembly.
10 ullam partem sensus] ‘ any particle of feeling '.
11 vereor] cp. Acad. 11. 5 ac vereor interdum ne talium personarum cum
amplificare velim, minuam etiam gloriam.
summorum virorum] Brutus, Cassius and the rest.
13 quid...eum] in Att. XVI. 11 ἓ 2 Cicero says he should like to alter
these words to nonne indignissimum est hunc vivere (VVeseuberg).
vivere] Cicero says in a letter to Cassius, Fam. X11. 4, vellem Idibus
Martiis me ad cenam (Caesar's murder) invitasses, reliquiarum nihil
