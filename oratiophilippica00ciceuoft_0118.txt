90 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXI 52

as sometimes in English when we speak of ‘the powers that be ¹, cp.
Luke xii. 11, ‘and when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto
magistrates and powers’. The distinction between imperiis and potes-
tatibus may perhaps be represented by ‘military and civil powers ',
though it must be remembered that potestas could be used of military as
well as civil powers.

31 contulisses] the two tribunes Antony and Cassius were driven from
the senate house and fled from Rome to Caesar at Ravenna 3 with them
went Curio and Caelius.

ἓ 53.

p. 20. 1 omnia perturbare] ‘to create general confusion’‚ so we find
omnia miscere, permiscere, confundere.

2 quid...a'icel)at] ⁶ why, did not Caesar himself say so?’

3 intercessio neglecta] Caesar says (B. C. Ι. 7) that in his address to the
troops at Ravenna he complained novom in re publica introductum
exemplum ut tribunicia intercessio armis notaretur atque opprimeretur.
he reminded them Sullam nudata omnibus rebus tribunicia potestate
tamen intercessionem liberam reliquisse ,· Pompeium, qui amissa restituisse
videatur, etiam quae ante habuerint ademisse.

4 circumscriptus] ‘circumscribed’, ‘thwarted'; the word is so used
elsewhere of the impeding of a magistrate’s action, cp. Caes. B. C. 1. 3²
crudelitatem et insolentiam (inimicorum praedicat Caesar) in circumscri-
bendis tribunis plebis ; Cic. Phil. XIII. 19.

7 a'e Caesare] se. loquor or loquar.

8 persona tua] Cicero generally has consistere in aliqua re but the
simple ablative is found in the best MS here and in Phil. 111. 19 cum eo
salus...consisteret, where, as here, the later MSS insert in. Perhaps it
should be inserted in both passages, as it might easily have fallen out in
the latter after cum or cu, in the former after belli, especially if it were
written ἶ.

ἓδέ.

10 memoriae... prodi] beware of translating these as if they were perfects.
13 quod] by attraction for qui, cp. Phil. v. 39 Pompeio enim patre, quod
imperio populi Romani lumen fuit, exstincto interfectus est patris similli-
musfilius and other instances quoted by HM.
decus ac lumen] the same phrase is used of Brutus in Phil. XI. ²4·
