ΧΧὶςΙΠ 82] NOTES. 113

tribe to vote first was imitated from the comitia tributa, only instead of
a tribe, a century was so chosen‚ called on that account praerogativa, and
the method of choosing it was called sortitio praerogativae. Each of the 35
tribes was now divided into two parts, consisting of five centuriae iunio-
rum and five centuriae seniorum, thus making 70 divisions (half tribes).
F urthermore each of the five original Servian classes was now made to
consist of 70 centuries, making the whole number of centuries 350.
These five classes became fused with the tribes in such a way that each
tribe contained 10 centuries, that is, two (one seniorum and one iunio-
rum) fr0m each of the five classes, thus making up the number 350. The
vote given by the praerogativa was regarded as an omen, and Cicero
goes so far as to say that in consular elections no instance was known of
a person carrying its votes without being subsequently elected by a
majority of the whole body of voters; Plane. 49. The probable details
of the change in the comitia here briefly described will be found in

P. 30. 1 renuntiatur] ‘the result is announced’, by the presiding
magistrate who had it publicly declared by a praeco ‘herald’ (leg. agr.
11. 4, Verr. 11. 5. 38); cp. Plane. 49 vocatae tribus, latum suffragium,
diribitae [tabellae], renuntiatum (so 1 should read for the renuntiatae of
the MSS, due to the previous feminine).

2 renuntiatur ; deinde, ita ut adsolet, suffragia ; tum secunda classis
vocatur] the text cannot be right as it stands, but there is great diversity
of view as to the proper method of correcting it. Mommsen proposes
deinde equitum ut adsolet mffragia ς the word ita only found in the
Vatican MS may represent an early corruption of equitum, which if written
equiti? might easily become ita between deinde and ut: another sugges-
tion is that tum before secunda is the remains of equitum, which seems
less likely: A. Augustinus proposes deinde, ita ut adsolet, suffragatum
secunda classis vocatur: Madvig would simply strike out renuntiatur:
for other suggestions see edition of Orelli, Baiter and Halm, 1856.
Mommsen's conjecture would be more convincing if we knew in what
place the 18 centuries of equites voted, but in regard to this little or
nothing is known. Another proposal of Mommsen’s is to put sex before
suffragia, which would denote the sex suffragia equitum which arose by
the duplication (attributed to the time of Tarquin) of the three original
