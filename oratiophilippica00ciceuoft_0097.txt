XI 28] NOTEs. 69

by his master with the siege of Massilia. He tried to engage Antony
in the plot against Caesar's lise, cp. Plut. Ant. 13.

persuasi...suadere] suadere is to try and convince a person, persua-
dere to succeed in convincing him. Our word ‘persuade' is ambiguous.

28 quo] ‘whereby’‚ ‘wherefore’. Improved modern feeling regards
Trebonius as one of the basest of traitors.

30 depulsor] not elsewhere in Cicero or any author of this period: the
word seems to have been applied to Jupiter as ‘averter’ of ills.

31 L, Tillius Cimber] he too was at first a staunch partisan of Caesar
who had entrusted him with the province of Bithynia. On the ides of
March Cimber approached Caesar with a petition for his brother who
was in exile, and the rest of the conspirators crowded round him as
though to further his request. After the murder he returned to
Bithynia.

p. 11. 2 duos Servilios] P. Servilius Casca and C. Servilius Casca. As
they were a branch of the Servilian gens, Cicero hesitates whether to
give them the surname Casca or Ahala: see note on ξ 26 1. 17. P. Casca
struck the first blow and then called on his brother to aid.

3 rei publicae] objective genitive after caritas, ‘affection for the
republic ’.

ἓ 28.

8 Ciceronem nominatim exclamavit] ‘called aloud on Cicero by name ’:
this use of exclamare seems rare: in Plaut. Amph. 1120 voce clara
exclamat uxorem tuam, quoted by LS.‚ inclamat should probably
be read.

11 appellandi met] the object (me) is attracted into the case of the
gerund3 the gerund receives adjectival inflexions and is made to agree
with the object in number and gender and is then called the gerundive.
R. ἓ 1374, 1395. For instance ‘the reason for calling the woman'
would be not caussa appellandi mulierem (geruud), but caussa appel-
landae mulieris (gemndive).

consimilem] ‘precisely similar’, stronger than similem: the word
takes a genitive or a dative.

13 laudium] laus is frequently used of a praiseworthy action, ep. Att
11. 25 quam ornate nostras laudes in astra sustulit where it almost:
‘merits’. The form laudium seems well attested.
