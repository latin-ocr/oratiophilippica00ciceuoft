XXXV 89] NOTES. 119

29 em‘entz'tis] ementior is one of the deponents that has a passive participle,
cp. note on ξ 85 1. 31.
tamen] ‘ notwithstanding ' that they were forged.
30 putares] ‘ because (as Ι was told) you thought' ; Cicero is quoting a

report‚ hence the mood.
sustulit] so far as Caesar was concerned the 15 March was abruptly

cut short by his death3 hence fortune is said to have ‘ removed that day
for the state ’t reipublicae is dative ‘ of advantage ².

32 z‘ncz'dz] ‘ Ι have lighted on ’-

33 praevertendum est] from the deponent praevertor which is thus used z
praevertor hanc rem ‘ I turn myself to this thing first', and with a
dative added praevertor lzanc rem illi rei ‘ Ι turn myself to this thing
before that’: from this we have the gerund praevertendum as here ;
thus quod is the accusative after praevertendum: ‘to which I must
address myself before (touching on) those subjects on which 'my speech
had already entered ’ : cp. Div. 1. 10 si vacas animo neque habes aliquid

quod huic sermoni praevertendum pute53 Liv. XXXV. 33 aliud in prae-
sentia praevertendum sibi esse dixit3 Plaut. Cist. V. 1. 8 praevorti hoc

certum est rebus aliis omnibus where LS. Wrongly say praevorti is passive.
See LS. for other uses of the word.

p. 32. 2 ex illa fiega...te...recepistz] the phrase ex fuga se recipere is
common 3 we should say ‘in flight’ 3 ex seems to be used because the
flight is looked upon as an action or state from which recourse is had to

shelter; cp. Caes. B. G. VII. 20.

ἓ 89.

4 frustra] this should be taken closely with verissima ‘alas for those
prophetie warnings of mine, always in vain so exaetly true ’.
6 cum] slightly causal, hence the mood of vellent.
7 omnia te promissurum] ‘ that there was nothing you would not
promise ’.
9 irent redirent] cp. note on isti redisti ἓ 78 1. 27 z ‘ went to and fro ':
cum is concessive, ‘ although ’, hence the subjunctive.
in sententia mansi] ‘ Ι abode by my resolution ' of not seeing you.
1² post diem tertium] 17 March, the festival of the Liberalia ς a variation
for tertio post die ‘on the third day after’, which by the inclusive method
of reckoning adopted by the Romans would be the 17th 3 the 16th is
postero die as above.
