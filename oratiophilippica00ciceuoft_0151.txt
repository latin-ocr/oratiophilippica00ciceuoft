XXXJH 94] NOTES. 123

funestae] Cicero speaks of the money in the treasury invidiously
as funestae, implying that it had been raised at the cost of suffering
to the people, cp. Phil. 1. 17 pecunia utinam ad Opis maneret! cruenta
illa quidem, sed lzis temporibus, quoniam eis quorum est non redditur,
necessaria. Notice that pecuniae is genitive in apposition to sestertium,
which has to be supplied with septiens miliens.

18 tributis] Roman citizens were practically exempt from the tributum
after Β. C. 167, when the state became possessed of large treasures
by the conquest of Macedonia by L. Aemilius Paulus, though it was
open to the authorities to reimpose it whenever need should arise3 and
Cicero's remark here shows that he saw the possibility of such need: in
fact the tribute was reimposed in 43. It consisted in a tax of 1 per 1000
(raised at one time to 3 per 1000) on the property of Roman citizens as
valued in the censor's books. Sometimes the money was repaid when
the treasury was enriched by a successful war, and it may have been
always regarded merely as a loan.

vindicare] ‘release'.

20 ea quidem] sc. decreta, to be supplied from decretum below.

21 a tuis] ‘from your friends’ not ‘ by your friends’.

2 2 Deiotaro] Deiotarus, tetrarch of Galatia, had been set over Armenia by
Pompey in 64 or 63 and allowed the title of ‘king’. As Pompey’s ally
he incurred the enmity of Caesar, against whose life he was accused of
having plotted. Cicero, with whom he was on terms of friendship‚
defended him in Β. C. 45 in a speech still extant.

24 in ipso dolore] cp. ξ 76 l. 23 ex ilfiso cursu.

ἐκ.

25 huic ordini] the senatorial order, whom Cicero is supposed to be
addressing.

26 ut] as aeque ut is unknown to Cicero, it is suggested that ut should
be altered to et (as in Cluent. 195) orto aut (Koch, Reid) 3 unless ut
is to be taken quite independently of aeque.

equestri] the equestrian order mostly sided with Pompey.

Massiliensibus] Caesar's officers Trebonius and D. Brutus besieged
Massilia (Marseilles) when held for Pompey Β. C. 49. The siege is
described by Caesar B. C. 11. 1—16.

⁴28 praesens] Caesar saw Deiotarus during his Asiatic campaign in 47,
and was his guest for a time, cp. hospitem below; Deiot. 8.

1 0—2
