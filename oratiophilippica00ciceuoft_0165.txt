XLII 109] NOTES. 137

exploits '‚ thus the usage is almost equivalent to ‘not only not...but also'.
The words sedpolius...laetatus est are parenthetical.

29 quz]=curn is ‘though he', in concessive sense, cp. below cum deberet
‘though he was bound'.

3¹ concutere] ‘shake to its foundations'.

3² numerum..prorogavit] ‘he extended the number of years sor the
tenure of provinces ’‚ cp. Phil. 1. 19, where the old rule enacted by Caesar
is stated ne praetoriae provinciae plus quam annum neve plus quam bien-
nium consulares obtinerentur, V. 7 tribuni plebi tulerunt de provinciis
contra acta C. Caesaris: ille biennium, lzi sexennium; in V111. 28, Att.
XV. 11 ἓ 4 five years (quinquennium) is named as the time: in the
former case the year of succession is probably taken into account
(Mommsen in HM. Introd. note 211). From Phil. V. 7 we gather that
the change only affected the consular provinces, and perhaps was only
intended by Antony to apply to Dolabella and himself. Notice that the
bill was brought in by the tribunes at the suggestion of Antony; his
brother L. Antonius was one of them.

p. 39. 1 publicis] rebus must be mentally supplied with publicis and
privatis, which are of the feminine gender, from the previous clause,
otherwise Cicero would probably not write in publicis (neuter) for ‘in
public affairs ’, but cp. Q. Fr. 1. 1 g 33 publicis male redemptis, quoted
by Draeg. 1². ἓ 21.

3 sine promulgatione] cp.§ 6 l. 19: ‘he annulled some (of Caesar's)
laws by others which were never promulgated '.

ut tolleret promulgavit] ‘he promulgated others in order that he
might annul’ (Caesar’s).

5 infimis civibus] dative of ‘the indireet object' or ‘person interested ',
here almost a dative of the agent3 this dative is in Cicero chiefly con-
fined to the perfect participle, cp. Off. ΙΙΙ. 38 honesta enim bonis viris,
non occulta quaeruntur. Madv. L. G. ἓ 2 50 a.

6 hortis] cp. Suet. Caes. 83 populo hortos circa Tiberim publice, et
viritim trecenos sestertios legavit.

7 Scipionis] P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, who being adopted by Q. Cae-
cilius Metellus Pius acquired the name Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio.

He seems to have been spoken of indifferently as P. Scipio Nasica,
Q. Metellus Scipio, P. Scipio Metellus, or Scipio simply. He was
consul with Pompey in 52. His villa was mentioned above, ἓ 42.
