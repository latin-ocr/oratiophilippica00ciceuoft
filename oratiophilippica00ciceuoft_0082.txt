repressive measure, cp. Cael. 70. Cicero was extremely proud of
receiving his commendation, cp. Sest. 121 me...quem Q. Catulus, quem
multi alii saepe in senatu patrem patriae nominarant ; Pis. 6 me Q.
Catulus princeps huius ordinis et auctor publici consili, frequentissimo
senatu, parentem patriae nominavit. He died probably in 59, Att. 11.

duobus Lucullis] (i) L. Licinius Lucullus Ponticus, cos. B.C. 74 with
M. Aurelius Cotta, a very able general, who conducted campaigns under
great disadvantages against Mithridates and Tigranes in 69—67. His
well earned triumph was delayed till 63, cp. Acad. 11. 3. See the
admirable account of his campaign iu Mommsen IV. c. 2. (ii) his
brother M. Terentius Varro Lucullus cos. B.C. 73 with C. Cassius
Varus. He gained some victories in Thrace for which he was allowed
the honour of a triumph in 71.

M. Crasso] M. Licinius Crassus, who on account of his great wealth
received the agnomen of Dives, was consul with Cn. Pompeius twice, in
70 and in 55. In 60 he was one of the first triumvirate which consisted
of Caesar, Pompey and Crassus. He was defeated by the Parthians
and slain in battle near Carrhae in Mesopotamia in 54: cp. above ξ 7.

Q. Hortensio] cos. B.c. 69 with Q. Caecilius Metellus. He was next
to Cicero the greatest Roman advocate: he died in 50.

C. Curioni] C. Scribonius Curi0‚ father of the Curio often mentioned
in this speech. He was consul in 76 with Cn. Octavius. He fought
against the Maesians and Dardanians, and was the first Roman general
who reached the Danube: he died in 53. For his praise of Cicero’s
consulship cp. Att. Ι. 16 ἓ 13 consulatum illum nostrum quem Curio
ἀποθέωσιν vocabat.

C. Pisoni] C. Calpurnius Piso, cos. B.C. 67 with M’. Acilius Glabrio
On his return from his proconsulship in Gaul he was charged with extor-
tion and was successfully defended by Cicero.

M’. Glabrioni] see last note. He was appointed successor to Lucul-
lus in the Mithridatio war.

M. Lepido] cos. in B.C. 66 with L. Volcatius Tullus. He was grand-
son os M. Aemilius Lepidus, cos. 158 and sixth in descent from the like-
named consul of 285. ’

L. Volcatio] see last note. Observe that the former consul was
designated by his cognomen Lepidus, but this one by his nomen Volca-
tius ; cp. Sull. 11 Lepido et Volcatio consulibus with Cat. Ι. 15 Lepido et
Tullo consulibus ; so little fixity of usage was there in these matters.
