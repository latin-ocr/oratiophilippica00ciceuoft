44 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [11

7 atque] almost=atqui ‘and yet’.
in aliis] ‘in the case of others’: aliis must not be translated ‘tlte
others’, though that is practically what Cicero means.

8 inimicus] mark the usual distinction between inimicus the enemy of
an individual and hostis (as above, rei publicae hostis) the enemy of a
state: cp. below ἓ 2 hostem patriae...milzi inimicus.

voluntarius] beware of translating ‘no one was my voluntary enemy’:
the meaning is ‘no one was my enemy of my own free will '.

10 furiosior] ‘more frenzied’. Cicero frequently applies the words
furor, furiosus, furia, to Clodius, and Plutarch speaks of his μανία ; he
was no doubt a man of fierce and ungovernable passions.

ultro] ‘unprovoked’3 this refers to Antony’s speech on 19 Sept.‚
cp. Phil. v. 19: in the first Philippic Cicero had spoken guardedly and
deprecated all intention of offending Antony.

12 ad] ‘in the sight of’: Att. VIII. 4 ξ 1 quae etiam ad ceteros contempti
cuiusdam hominis commendatio defuit?

§a

14 mediocritate] said with a touch of Cicero’s usual mock humility.

17 testimonium] a supplicatio or public thanksgiving was decreed to
Cicero in 63 on the motion of L. Aurelius Cotta in highly flattering
terms quod urbem incendiis, caede civis, Italiam bello liberassem, quae
supplicatio si cum ceteris supplicationibus conferatur, boc interest, quod
ceterae bene gesta, haece una conservata re publica constituta est. Cat.
111. 15: cp. Cat. lv. 20, Phil. 11. 13, XIV. 24, Pis. 6 milzz' togato senatus
non, ut multis, bene gestae sed, ut nemini, conservatae rei publicae
singulari genere supplicationis deorum immortalium templa patefecit.
He was the first togatus who had ever enjoyed the honour of a suppli·
catio, cp. note on ἓ 13, 1. 9.

multis] observe the emphasis given to this word by its position, and
the strong contrast which it thus affords to mihi uni.

18 contentione dicendi] ‘an oratorical combat'‚ ‘a contest of rhetoric’3
cp. Plin. Ep. 1. 2.

19 quid...ubm·us] ‘what more copious, what more fertile theme’.

21 illud profecto] ‘the following of course was his reason’ (for attacking
me): illud does not refer to anything going before, but anticipates the
following sentence non existimavit &c.; with it must be mentally

supplied cogitavit or the like; cp. Tusc. IV. 47 reperiam fortasse, sed
illud ante (sc. dicam).
