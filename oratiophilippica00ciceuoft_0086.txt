58 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [VI 15

22 tu...rcjseras] a wondering indignant question ‘would you reser?’ it is
found with all three persons, cp. Planc. 93 ego eum non tuear? ego
C. Caesaris laudibus desim? Phil. vl. 5 an ille id faciat?...kuic denun-
tiationi ille pareat? the usage is fully illustrated by Draeger Hist. Synt-
ἓ 526: cp. above ἓ 5 cum tu occideres? The subjunctive is probably an
apodosis to an implied protasis.

24 refiras] notice how forcibly the intended contrast is brought out
by this referas being placed immediately aster the other and without
any adversative particle, such as autem.

26 videlicet] ‘it is clear ', ‘forsooth': introduces an ironical statement.

27 pudorem] ‘sense of honour', pudicitia ‘modesty’.

28 in eo templo] the temple of Concord built by M. Furius Camillus
B.C. 367, cp. Ovid Fasti 1. 639, Plut. Camill. 42: see below ξ 19 and
Phil. 11 Ι. 3ο where it is called cella Concordiae, in Phil. V. 20 it is aedes
Concordiae. It stood at the upper or north-western end of the forum.
In its latest restoration “ the pronaos is smaller than the cella, and forms
a kind of porch to it, and the cella has greater breadth than depth3 the
former measuring 82 feet in breadth and 45 in depth, and the latter 147
feet in width by 78 in depth ''‚ Bum, Rome and the Campagna p. 91.
The senate could only hold its sittings in a templum, i.e. a place (not
necessarily a covered building) which had received the divine sanction
by the process of inauguratio at the hands of the augurs. The ceremony
of ‘consecrating’ (consecratio) a building was performed by one of the
higher magistrates.

ς 16.

31 tu] emphatic: ‘such a person as you'.
clivom Capitolinum] for the event cp. Halm-wilkins Introduction to
Catil. speeches ἓ 26. The date was 5 Dec. 63.

32 servorum] probably to be taken literally ‘slaves', not as HM.
“knights as Cicero's vassals'' (J.S.R.).

33 credo] the parenthetic credo as usual introduces an ironical statement z
‘1 suppose I applied force to the senate to make them pass those wicked

decrees'. He means the decrees by which the conspirators were
executed and their property confiscated.

nefaria] this word is no doubt a quotation from Antony.

p. 7. 1 o miser] the exclamation o is followed either by a nominative or
an accusative, according as the person or thing spoken of with astonish-
ment is regarded by the speaker as subject or object of an action: here
