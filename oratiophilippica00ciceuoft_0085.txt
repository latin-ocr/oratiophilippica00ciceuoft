VI 15] NOTES. 57

§1AE

L. Caesar] Antony’s father, M. Antonius Creticus, married Iulia sister
of L. Iulius Caesar, who was consul in 64: see note on ἓ 12 1. 25: cp.
Phil. vm. 1, 2.

12 vz'tn'cum] ‘stepfather’: P. Lentulus Sura who married Antony’s
widowed mother Iulia: cp. Cat. lv. 13 L. Caesar...sororis suae...virum
praesentem et audientem vita privandum esse dixit. He voted for the
execution of his brother-in-law Lentulus one of the Catilinarian con-
spirators.

14 te similem...maluist2] cp. Phil. V. 6 qnae essent, si te consulem quam
hostem maluisses, tuae: which may be compared both for the accusative
and infinitive construction after malle, and also sor the omission of esse:
contrast with this Phil. V. 3 inimicus quam amicus esse maluit. The
twofold construction of malle, velle is akin to that of cupere, e.g. cupio
videri ‘I wish to seem ’, or cupio me videri ‘I wish that I should seem’ ε
see Halm on Cat. 11. 4 (ed. wilkins), cp. below ξ 19 cupit enim se
audacem.

15 usus sum] Cicero followed the advice that L. Caesar and others gave
him that the conspirators should be put to death.

16 ecquid] ‘did you ever refer any matter of state to him for conside·
ration?'

g· 15.

18 descendit] supply in forum: descendere was the regular term sor going
into the forum, which was situated on comparatively low ground.

19 nataliciam] sc. cenam, a birthday feast.

hortis] the house and grounds once belonging to Pompey, see
below ἓ 67.

20 Phormz'onz] Cicero proceeds to mention three characters from Latin
comedy; how far they are intended to represent living persons it is
hard to say: cp. Caec. 27 argmtam'us Sex. Clodius, cui nomen est
Phormio, nec minus nzssger nec minus confidens quam ille Terentianus est
Phormio. This is perhaps a different person from the Sex. Clodius
referred to above ἓ 9, as well as stom the rhetorician mentioned in ξ 43.

Gnathoni] a parasite in the Eunuchus of Terence.

21 Ballioni] a disreputable character in the Pseudolus of Plautus. In
a speech delivered in B.c. 76 Cicero compared a Greek adventurer
C. Fannius Chaerea to Ballio, Rosc. Corn. ξ 20.

P. P. 6
