people must think that he is in collusion with me and while pretending
to attack is really aiding me, sor to have taken part in such a glorious

7 societatefacti] for the genitive of description cp. 32 consili societatem.

8 fuis-set] the indicative fuerat would have been possible, but the
subjunctive generalises the statement, qui being almost equivalent to
dummodo is ‘provided that he bad been ’.

9 occultatum dico ?] a frequent rhetorical trick with Cicero os repeating
a word interrogatively with dico and then rejecting it as insufficient and
