13 quid gessi, quid egz] so sar as there is a difference here between these
two words, gerere implies a course of action or policy, while agere is
more restricted to definite actions. Notice here the two triplets constitui,
gessi, egi and consilio, auctoritate, sententia. Cicero probably intended
each noun to be specially appropriate to the corresponding verb: he
made his plans (constitue) in accordance with the general views (con-
sz'lz‘um) of the senate ; he carried out his policy (gessi) under their
sanction (auctoritas); he acted on each occasion (ege) in accordance with
their vote (sententia).

18 inventus] for the form of this sentence cp. §22 id...tu inventus es qui
dicere53 ξ 85 tu ergo unus, scelerate, inventus es quz'...velles; ἓ 64 unus
inventus est qm· id auderet.

fatum] Clodius was murdered by Milo on the Appian road3 Curio
was slain in battle with Juba king of Mauretania.

19 id] by ‘the thing that was fatal to each of them’ Cicero means
Fulvia, who married first Clodius, then Curio, then Antony. By the
word fatale he probably means little more than ‘fraught with mischief',
‘baneful', for Fulvia cannot be accused of having caused the death
of Clodius or of Curio except so far as she may have urged thern on the
reckless course that led to their ruin. It should be noticed that modern

taste would absolutely condemn such a reference as this to the domestic
relations of a political opponent: cp. 77.

Claudius Pulcher. He died in this year 44. In 78—76 he commanded
an expedition against the pirates that infested the coast of Asia Minor
and marching inland waged a sanguinary war against the Cilicians,
