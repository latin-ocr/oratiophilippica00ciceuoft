XLIII 110] NOTES. 139

sive quod] for the form of the sentence cp. ξ 16 l. 1, where however
the interjection o is followed by the nominative.

hodiernus dies] Sept. 19th, on which day Cicero ought to have
delivered this speech.

quartum] the ludi Romani lasted Sept. 4—18. See the Calendars
in MM. VI. p. 5 59 and in XVordsworth ‘Fragments and Specimens of
Early Latin’ p. 270, from the latter of which it appears that the games
on Sept. 15—18 had the special appellation of ludi Romani in circo: to
thaee games in the Circus Antony had added a fifth day, Sept. 19, in
honour of Caesar, so that henceforth the ludi Romani lasted 16 days.
The whole subject of these games is involved in great obscurity‚ as may
be seen by anyone who consults the various authorities.

praetextatz] it is by no means clear whether Cicero is here speaking
in the capacity of augur, senator or ex-curule magistrate:.HM. (ed. 2,
1865) say ‘it seems that the augurs used their privilege of wearing the
praetexta only on festivals or when engaged in the duties of their func-
tion': Manutius and others (followed by SDA. ‘ loga') considered that
the senators were entitled to wear the praetexta on festivals: lastly
Halm (ed. 6) follows M M. I. 3 5 3, note 1 in the view that Cicero is here
speaking as one who had held curule office, and that such persons had
the privilege of resuming the praetexta on festal occasions. Mommsen
finds a similar reference to the praetexta of the ex-consul in Phil. VIII.
32 non ita gerimus nos hoc bello consulares, ut aequo animo populus
Romanus visurus sit nostri honoris insigni& and Liv. Epit. 19. To the
last-mentioned view I incline.

honorem Caesaris] ‘honour paid to Caesar '.

desert] ‘abandoned'‚ ‘disregarded’z for some reason or other the
proposed celebration of Caesar on the fifth day of the ludi in circo

γ (Sept. 19th) seems to have been disregarded.

an supplicationes...conserva] Cicero makes a general complaint of
inconsistency against Antony, which resolves itself into two main heads,
(i) he had proposed that the fifth day of the ludi in circo should be
consecrated to Caesar and yet neglects to see that this proposal is
carried out; (ii) although constituted flamen to Caesar he yet neglects
to fulffl the duties of a flamen, as though he thought that the pulm'nam·a
would be contaminated by 'meing associated with the worship of a
mortal, though he had not thought that the supplicationes were con-
taminated by the addition to them of an extra day in Caesar's honour.
