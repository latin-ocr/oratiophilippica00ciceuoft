130 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXXIX 101

illud paene] “that word ‘almost’ ”: Cicero would like it to be no
longer said that Antony had ‘almost' failed to escape alive from Capua.
6 prandiorum apparatus] ‘elaborate luncheons'. Romans in good
health and of simple habits took only two meals in the day, the first
called prandium (sometimes ientaculum) probably about 9 or 10 a.m.‚
and then cena (dinner) about 1 or 2 p.m.‚ but people of more sashionable
habits took three, ientaculum a very slight early breakfast, prandium

lunch, cena about 3 p.m. a meal which lasted some time. Note that to
render cena by ‘supper’ is absurd.

8 illa] ‘the following'3 cp. illud in ἓ 2.
agrum...a'2'vz·debas] the sentence is slightly ungrammatical, because
one expects a verb to which qui should be the subject: it would have
been quite regularis Cicero had written qui de vectzgalz'bus exemptus...
magnum z'nflzgere rei publicae volnus videbatur.
de vectigalibus] supply agris: cp. Suet. Caes. 20 agrum Campanum
ad subsidia rei publicae vectigalem relictum, divisit extra sortem ad
viginti millibus civium, cp. above, ξ roo 1. 2.
9 tamen] ‘nevertheless', i.e. notwithstanding that it was assigned to
soldiers.

10 compransoribus] a word coined for the occasion: in modern phrase
‘your companions of the luncheon and the card table ’.

11 dividebas] mark the tense ‘were sor dividing’, ‘ proposed to divide'.

13 Leontino] cp. note on ἓ 43 l. 17.

quoniam quidem] ‘since indeed’; these words give the reason for a
thought which had rapidly passed through the writer’s mind but had not
been expressed, such as ‘our loss is evident‚ since indeed ’, &c.

arationes] cultivated domain lands, paying a tithe (usually) of the
produce: the occupants of these lands were called aratores, cp. Phil. 111.
22 en cur magister eius (Sex. Clodius) ex oratore arator sactus sit.

15 grandiferae] ‘fertile', a very rare word. Dr Reid doubts the forma-
tion and suggests that Cicero may have written gmm‘firae, a word only
quoted by LS. from Ovid Met. VII. 638 in a different sense.

fructuosae] ‘profitable ’‚ perhaps from fructus in its derived sense of
‘profit ', ‘revenue', rather than in sense of ‘fruits', ‘produce’: cp. Off.

111. 5 tola philosophia est frugifera etfrucluosa. In Phil. V111. 26 Cicero
says these domains were annonae perfugia.

medico] his name is unknown.
