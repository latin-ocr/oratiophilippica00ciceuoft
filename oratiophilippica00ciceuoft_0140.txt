1 1 2 ΘΚΑ TI O PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XXXII 81

lit. ‘besore, by many months ⁹, cp. §8 tot annis post, ἓ 87 1. 24 multis
post seculis.
22 quodfecit] described in ἓξ, 82, 83.
24 de caelo servare] ‘to watch the sky’; the regular phrase for the
observation of heavenly signs ; de caelo auspicari is also used.
quod neque licet] Cicero here tacitly assumes the validity of the
Clodian laW, see above. The plural leges seems to be used vaguely3 as

we osten speak of an act being contrary to ‘the laws‘, though there may
be only one law applicable to the case.

25 non comitiis habitis] the unfavourable sign had to be announced
before the conclusion of the election.

26 implicata] the participle implicitus was probably not used by Cicero.

27 impudentia] ablative ς, ‘his ignorance is bound up with impudence'‚
cp. Vat. 3 inconstantiam tuam, cum levitate, tum etiam periurio impli-
catam.

5 82.

28 illo die] 1 Jan. 44, on which day Caesar had declared that Dolabella
should succeed him as consul suffectus. ι

29 apparitor] ‘clerk’, from apparere ‘to be at hand', ‘to wait on', cp.
Liv. 11. 55 quattuor et viginti lictores apparere consulibus: a general
name sor the lower class of officials in attendance on the magistrates ;
they include lictores, servi publici, architecti, scribae librarii, accensi,
praecones.

30 tam humilis, tam abiectus] cp. Fin. v. 57 nihil abiectum nihil humile
cogitant.

31 lecticam] a litter in the form of a couch carried by bearers; as
a rule they were only used on journeys‚ or in the city by invalids
or people of effeminate habits. Caesar tried to check the use of
them, Suet. Caes. 43, yet from this passage we gather that he was
in the habit of using one himself, perhaps because he was not in strong
health, Suet. Caes. 86. The words in aversam lecticam must mean ‘in
at the back of the litter’‚ i. e. at the upper end, where lay the head of the
person reclining in it; Antony would thus make his requests of Caesar
in a confidential whisper.

33 dies] apparently in March, but the exact day is not known; Lange
1112. 477·

sortitio praerogativae] after the reform of the comitia centuriata
(probably in B. C. 241 ; Lange 112. 468) the custom of choosing by lot a
