XXXJX 101] NOTES. 129

shameless of Antony to make such a charge in the senate, outrageous
to accuse Dolabella with it, disgusting to speak of it before the elder
Antony, cruel to bring such a foul charge against Antonia.

ς 100.

25 quae] ‘ what enquiry into them was there on your part ? ’
27 quae quidem] ‘ that is to say, such as Caesar had (really) performed’:
for the restrictive subjunctive cp. ξ 7, 1. 31. ⁴

28 ista] that supply of ‘ autographs ' that you possess.

30 Kal. Iun.] cp. Phil. 1. 6 ecce enim Kalendis Iuniis, quibus ut adesse-
mus edixerant (Antony and Dolabella), mutata omnia : nz‘lzz'l per
senatum, multa et magna per populum, et absente populo et invito.
Antony found the process of consulting with the senate about Caesar's
acta too slow, and promulgated a law of his own in April by which the
‘ acts of Caesar ' were confirmed.

consilio] a bench of assessors, chosen from the senate ε the subject of
cognosceretis is Antony and Dolabella, see last note.

32 ad quas] ‘on (at) which': quibus might have been used as in Phil. 1.
6 quoted above.

33 peragratis] Antony left Rome in April and spent some time in visit-
ing the various colonies of veteran soldiers in order to win thern over to
his cause, cp. Att. XIV· 21 ξ 2, written 12 May, nosti virum (Balbum),
quam tectus, sed tamen Antoni consilia narrabat: illum circumire vete-
ranos, ut acta Caesaris sancirent idque se facturos esse iurarent, ut arma
omnes haberent eaque duumviri omnibus mensibus inspicerent.

p, 36. 1 mense Aprili atque Alaio] Maio is added as an afterthought,

hence the singular mense, contrast ἓ 101 arationes Campana et Leontina.

2 Capuam] Capua was already a colony of Roman citizens established

by Caesar B. C. 59, cp. Suet. Caes-ao, Vell. 11. 44, and therefore,

as Cicero argued, Antony could not legally conduct a fresh colony

thither, cp. below ἓ 102. Capua, which before 209 was a flourishing

municipal town, was then degraded and lost most of its political rights.

4 paene non abiem's] Antony’s proceedings at Capua seem to have
caused a disturbance imperilling his life.

ξ 101.

cui] ‘and this town (Capua) you are now threatening'.
5 conere] supply eo deducere caloniam ‘to conduct a colony thither’.
