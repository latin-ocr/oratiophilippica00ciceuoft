46 ORA T l O PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [11 3

fuisse] “not esse, because according to Roman notions the death of
Fadius had dissolved the tie. Cic. Sest. 6 ademit Albino soceri nomen
mors filiae, Cluent. 41'’. HM.

at enim...tradideras] ‘but‚ to be sure, you had placed yourself under
my instruction’: we do not know what ground there was sor this
assertion of Antony; Cicero denies the truth of it. [Possibly there is
an allusion to the ‘school’ of rhetoric which Cicero jocularly says he
had opened (Fam. IX. 18 ἓ 1), which was attended by Hirtius and
Dolabella among others (Fam. IX. 16 ἓ 7) and may have been attended
by Antony. J.S.R.] at enim is an elliptical expression: at introduces
Antony’s second objection, and enim gives the reason for it: cp. ἀλλὰ
γάρ.

ne] this particle of asseveration (connected with ναί) is used by
Cicero only with personal pronouns or their cognate adverbs and
adjectives.

sz' cuperes] more regularly εἰ cupisse53 ‘if you wished’ instead of ‘if
you had wished': cp. Att. VII. 13 b ἕ 3 si scriberem (pse, longior epzlvtula
suisset3 XVI. 5 ἓ 2 Quintus fuit mecum dies compluris, et, sz' ego cuperem,
ille vel pluris fuisset3 other instances in Draeger Hist. Synt. ἓ 550 b β.
It is possible that Cicero intentionally avoided the pluperfect subjunctive
of cupio, he has it only once in his speeches, Mil. 21, though other
parts of the verb are frequent, and Caesar and his continuators never
have it.

C. Curionem] the well-known tribune who, at first an adherent of
Pompey and the optimates, afterwards espoused the cause of Caesar.
He died bravely fighting near Utica in Africa in 49. He exercised a
pernicious influence over Antony, cp. ἕ 45.

auguratus] Cicero was elected augur in the summer of 53 to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of P. Crassus (not M. Crassus as HM. say,
cp. Plut. Crass. 36) in the Parthian war. By the Domitian law of 104 (Ρ)
B.C.‚ which had been re·enacted in 63 after its abrogation by Sulla in
81, the election of augur rested with-a minority of the tribes (17 out of
35 chosen by lot). The candidates were first nominated by the members
of the augural college, each member being allowed to nominate one
candidate, but no candidate could be nominated by more than two
members—in Cicero's case the nominators were Cn. Pompeius and
