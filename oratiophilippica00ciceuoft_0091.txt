hid himself, securing his retreat by closing (oppilatis) the entrance,
probably by means of a door, cp. Cic. F ragm. 152, 44 (Nobbe) aperuit
fores sgalarum.

30 favisse] ‘gave you my countenance’.

3² rem transegit] above he says negotium transegzkses as we might say
‘finish the business'.

33 suspicaretur] notice the mood: ‘before anyone should (could) sus-
pect': suspicatus est would be ‘before anyone (actually) did suspect’.
“After ante quam, prius quam the indicative merely points out the fact
that of two events one succeeds the other in time, while the subjunctive
declares that their succession is willed by a person'’. Reid on Cic.
Balb. ξ 18.

at] ‘but‚ you say’3 this use of at, introducing an opponent's objection,
is very common in this speech, as elsewhere. Another common use of
atis to mark a transition from one argument or subject to another, ‘but
again', as in the first line of ἓ 20.

g 22.

p. 9. 3 quamquam] ‘and yet’ an enquiry was held.

4 non satis prudenter illa quidem constituta] ‘not quite wisely con-
stituted it is true⁷: this restrictive use of ille quidem which may be
translated ‘it is true’‚ followed by an adversative clause, is very
common in Cicero, cp. ἓ 66 multa et lauta supellex...n0n illa quidem
luxuriosi hominis, sed δια, ‘not, it is true, that of a person of luxurious
habits'3 R. ς 2259 foll.

5 nova lege] this was the lex Pompeia de vi, which being passed only
for a special occasion was called a privilegium. It was passed under
the influence of the intense excitement prevalent in Rome in conse-
quence of the murder of Clodius, and was intended to introduce a
more convenient and expeditious mode of procedure at the trial.
Its particulars are stated by Asconius in his introduction to the Milo,
of which a translation will be found in the Pitt Press edition of that
speech.

6 cum esset quaestio] ‘when there already existed a form of enquiry’.
The lex Plotia de vi might have been put in force, without recourse
being had to a new enactment such as that of Pompey.

8 tu es inventus] see note on ἓ 11 l. 18.
