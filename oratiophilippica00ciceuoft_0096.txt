19 qm'a'?] ‘again’.

C. Cassius] a member of the same family as Sp. Cassius Vecellinus
who in 486 Β. C. when consul brought forward an agrarian law and was
consequently put to death, his own father according to some authorities,
Livy 11. 41, taking a chief part in his prosecution. Hence Cicero says

at Pharsalus in 48 (cp. belovr, ξ 71), and Porcia sister of M. Porcius
Cato who committed suicide at Utica in 46. Caesar had spared the
lives of the two Domitii after the capture of Corfinium held by the elder
Domitius for Pompey in 49: Caes. Β. C. 1. 23.

26 sed mea auctoritas] in translating we should arrange this sentence
somewhat differently—‘ was it my authority, and not rather the death of

his father...that aroused Domitius to essay the recovery of liberty?’
