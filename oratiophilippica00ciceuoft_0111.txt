XVIlI 44] NOTES. 83

§44.

28 a puero] ‘from boyhood': Caes. B. G. IV. 1 has a pueris, and Cic.
Arch. 4 ex· pueris, a solitary instance, which may be compared with the
Greek ἐκ παίδων.

sic, opinor] ‘that, Ι think, is the way': in colloquial Latin, such as
this is here, sic was sometimes used almost in the sense of ‘yes'.

¹29 praetextatum] while still a youth, wearing the toga praetexta, i.e. a
toga with a purple fringe or edge: this was exchanged at an age which
cannot be definitely fixed, varying from the 15th to the 17th year, for
the toga virilis (see below) the assumption of which marked an im-
portant epoch in the life of the Roman youth and corresponded some-
what to our ‘coming of age'. The purple broidered robe worn by the
higher magistrates was also called toga praetexta.

30 decoxisse] properly ‘to boil away', hence used in sense of ‘fritter
away’, ‘squander', and so the word acquired the special sense ‘to run
through one's property', ‘become bankrupt'.

ista] iste here retains its ordinary sense, see note on ἓ 8 1. 10: ‘that
fault of which you (Cicero) speak’.

31 etenim] ‘and indeed '-

pietatis] ‘filial affection’ ; this is of course ironical.

illud] notice the omission of the substantive verb est or erat 3 this is
very common in short clauses of this nature, especially when they contain
the pronouns ille or lzic.

32 quattuordecim ordinibus] the front fourteen rows in the theatre were
appropriated by the lex Roscia, carried by the tribune L. Roscius Otho,
B.c. 67, to the equites, the orchestra seats being assigned to the senators.
His enactment probably only restored an old custom‚ cp. Mur. 40
equestri ordini restituit non solum dignitatem sed etiam voluptatem.
If Antony was born in 83 he was 16 at the passing of this law, and
it does not seem likely that a boy of this age who had not yet assumed
the toga vin'lzs would be expected because of his youthful extravagance
to take his seat among the declared bankrupts (decoctores).

33 quamvis] ‘however much'‚ not quite the same as quamquam
‘ although '.

p. 17. 1 virilem togam] the toga of manhood, sometimes called toga
pura because plain and unadorned, assumed by young Romans at about
the age of 16 ; see above,
