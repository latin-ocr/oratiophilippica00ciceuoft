48 ORATIO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [III 5

bringing his name into prominence. Att. XI. 7 ἓ 2. [Brundisii being
locative should probably be thus spelt, not Brundisi. This very word
occurs in Ennius, who does not use the genitive in -ii. J.S.R.]

32 ex latronibus suis] ‘out of all his banditti’. Caesar had entrusted
the care of Italy to Antony, and on his assumption of the dictatorship
had made him his magister equitum. Appian B. C. 11. 41, Plut. Ant. 6.

33 occideres] see note on ξ 16 1. 22.

p. 3. 3 quod sz] the argument is: if it were so great a benefit to refrain
from killing a person, Caesar’s murderers would never have gained such
credit for their deed, for they would have killed one who had conferred
a benefit on them, and would therefore have been guilty of the basest
ingratitude. Caesar had shown great consideration to some of those
who had fought against him; cp. Fam. VI. 6 ἓ 10 at nos quem ad
modum est complexus! Cassium sibi legavit ,· Brutum Galliae praefecit,
Sulpicium Graeciae; flIarcellum, cui maxime suscensebat, cum summa
illius dignitate restituit.

6 te abstinueris] se abstinere ‘to keep oneself from' a thing, is the usual
construction in early Latin and maintains its ground in Cicero, though
he occasionally (cp. ἓ 6) uses abstinere in sense of se abstinere, like our
‘abstain', which became the common construction in the Augustan
period. The French retain the pronoun‚ s’abstenir‚ and so in older
English, e.g. ‘ech man that stryveth in fyght‚ absteyneth him fro alle
thingis' Wyclif1 Cor. ix. 25 (A.D. 1382); ‘Wryte unto them that they
absteyne them selves from fylthynesse of Idols' Coverdale Acts Χν. 20

(A.D. 1535).
§6.

1 1 queri non debus] ‘ought Ι not to complain’: almost: ‘was it my duty
not to complain'. Notice that ‘ought' being strictly a past tense
represents debui, but as in modern English ‘ought’ is regarded as a
present tense one had better translate ‘ought I not to have complained’.

12 querella] the first Philippie.

13 gradu] the position of an ex-consul, and one of the leaders and
spokesmen of the optimates.

16 quod]=et illud, and anticipates the following acc. and inf. clause
querentem abstinere: ‘why‚ what sels-restraint did it argue'.

M. Antonio] said with emphasis: ‘complaining of such a person as
M. Antony’: cp. 11 non placet M. Antonio consulatus meus.
17 reliquias] HM. explains this of the treasure accumulated by Caesar
