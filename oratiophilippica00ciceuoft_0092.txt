ς 23.

9 idque] ‘and that too': in Greek καὶ ταῦτα.
11 uon tu quidem] for this restrictive quidem with the personal pronoun,
followed by an adversative clause, see above on l. 4.

12 temporibus] ‘dates’: ablative of the ‘thing in point of which ' a term
is applied or an assertion made, R. ἓ 1210.

13 M. Bibulo] M. Bibulus was consul with Caesar in B.C. 59. He
disapproved of many of the measures of his able and ambitious col-
league, but was too powerless to prevent them, and showed his dis·
pleasure by shutting himself up in his house for a considerable part of
the year, which gave rise to the lines non Bibulo quicquam nuper sed
Caesare factum est, Ι nam Bibulo fieri consule nz‘l memini. Cicero was
absent from Rome for the first half of this year, returning in June. It

was probably after this that he endeavoured to detach Pompey from
Caesar. His letters at this time contain many expressions of regard for
Pompey, who promised him protection against his enemy Clodius, and
at the same time of mistrust of his policy. Cicero’s own statements in
his letters to Atticus that he was watching the turn of events and
abstaining from political interserence, Att. 11. 22 ξ 3, seem at variance
with his assertion here that he did his utmost to detach Pompey from
Caesar; but cp. Fam. VI. 6 ξ 4 plurimi sunt testes me et initio, ne
coniungeret se cum Caesare, monuisse Pompeium, et postea ne se diiun-
geret.

16 ipse enim...diz'unxz'fl Cicero is probably thinking of the following
year 58 when Pompey notwithstanding Cicero's earnest entreaties
refused to save him from the persecution of Clodius, saying that he
could do nothing contrary to Caesar's wish: cp. Plutarch Cic. 30 ἐφ’ ᾧ
παροξυνθεὶς ὁ Καῖσαρ τόν τε Κλώδιον ἐπέρρωσε καὶ Πομπήιον ἀπέστρεψε
κομιδῆ τοῦ Κικέρωνος, αὐτός τε κατεμαρτύρησεν ἐν τῷ δήμῳ μὴ δοκεῖν αὐτῷ
καλῶς μηδὲ νομίμως ἄνδρας α’κρίτους ἀνῃρῆσθαι τούς περὶ Λέντλον καὶ
Κέθηγονε and see ib. 31 for the account of Cicero's interview with
Pompey referred to in Att. Χ. 4 ἓ 3; Forsyth Life of Cicero p. 183.

18 stulti ..impudenti-v] a good instance of the well-known grammatical
figure called ‘chiasmus ’.

20 suaserim] the subjunctive is consecutive, R. ἐξ 1680 foll.: the
