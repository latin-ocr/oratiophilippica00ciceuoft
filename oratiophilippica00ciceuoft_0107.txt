XV 39] NOTES. 79

phrase de nocte ‘from night ’, meaning almost the same as our ‘at night’:
de marks the starting-point of an action either in space or in time.
Pharsalus was a town in Thessaly, now called Fersala‚ about 25 miles
south of Larissa. [The adjective Pharsalius is doubtful in Cicero;
either read Pharsalica or Pharsalo, in the latter case taking ficga closely
with persecuti sunt. J.S.R.]

Paphum] aster the battle of Pharsalus Pompey proceeded to Mace·
donia, embarked at Amphipolis and sailed to Mytilene 3 thence he

journeyed by land to Cilicia and crossed over to Paphus in Cyprus.
From Cyprus he intended to go to Antioch‚ but, learning that the
inhabitants would not receive him, he sailed to Pelusium in Egypt. He
had no sooner stepped out of the boat that conveyed him from the ship
to the shore than he was murdered by Achillas, one of the officers of
king Ptolemaeus, and L. Septimius, a Roman tribune who had served
under him in the pirate war. Caes. B. C. 111. 102—104.

7 vidisse plus] ‘ had shown greater soresight'.

8 et] introducing an indignant question, ‘and then’: so in ἓ 51
et tu...contra me dicere ausus es ; ἓ 110 et tu in Caesaris memoria
diligens?

9 sectorem] cp. Phil. XIII. 30 utrum igitur aequius, utrum melius rei
publicae suit Cn. Pompeium an sectorem Cn. Pompei vivere Antonium ?
The term sector is used of one who purchases at a sale of confiscated
property, qui bona publica mercatur. Pompey’s property was confiscated
by the state and put up to auction.

1 I iocis] a few of Cicero's caustic remarks are given by Plutarch Cic. 38.
Antony seems to have reproached Cicero with joking at a time of great
trouble ancl distress, to which Cicero replies that such relaxation is
harmless and agreeable to the impulses of human nature. In a letter to
Curio Fam. 11. 4 written in 53 he expresses himself differently and
perhaps less wisely, iocerne tecum per litteras ἒ civem mehercule non puto
esse qui temporibus his ridere possit.

12 quidem] concessive, ‘it is true ', followed as is usual by an adver-
sative clause.

13 verum tamen...tamen] verum tamen correlates with the virtually
concessive clause erant quidem...curae ‘ true, that camp was full
of anxiety, yet notwithstanding' &ot then the second tamen cor-
relates with the second subordinate concessive clause quamvis in
turbidis rebus sint ‘in however harassed a situation they may be,
yet ' ὅτε.
