78 ΘΚΑ TJO PHILIPPICA SECUNDA. [XIV 37

lumina reipublicae] so in Balb. 34 the Scipios are called duo lumina
uestri imperi, cp. below, ξ 51 1. 12.

22 quamvis...pacis] ‘on however unfavourable terms of peace', cp. Att.
VII. 13 a ἓ 1 ut enim alia omittam decem annorum peccata quae condicio
von huic fugae praestitit? VH. 14 ἓ 3 equidem aa' pacem hortari non
desino, quae vel iniusta utilior est quam iustissimum bellum cum civibus ;
V111. 1 1 §6 mea quae semper fuerit sententia, primum de pace vel iniqua
condicione retinenda...meminisse te arbitror. These extracts serve to
show the earnestness of Cicero's desire for peace.

23 rem publicam] ‘our free constitution’: Caesar and Antony had in
Cicero's view all but destroyed the true ‘republic’.

ἓ 38.

24 ei] the leaders of the optimates headed by Pompey.

26 ut alia omittam] i-e. ‘not to speak of other advantages that woqu
have ensued'.

27 at vero] introducing an objection of Antony.

30 de summa re publica] ‘about the highest interests of the state': the
expression summa res publica is not uncommon, cp. Cat. 1. 14, Sest. 24,
διο. Sometimes we find summa rei publicae, where summa is a feminine
substantive, as in Plane. 52.

31 consuetudine amicitiae] ‘friendly intercourse'.

32 ego, quid ille] that is ego videbam quid ille sentiret et spectaret3 these
verbs are readily supplied by the reader from the corresponding verbs in
the following clause: so in the next sentence consulebam has to be
supplied with ego from the following consulebat. This kind of ellipse is
fully illustrated by Draeger Hist. Synt. 1², p. 215 who quotes Ov. Her.
X111. 40 ibsa novas vestes, dura vir arma ferat.

p. 15. 2 habebat quid sequeretur] ‘knew what he was following’‚ ‘knew
what his aim was’ 3 in such a phrase habere has almost the force of scire:
slightly different is habebat quod sequeretur ‘had something to follow’,
‘had a definite aim’. The distinction is clearly expressed by Holden

on Cic. Off. 11. 7: cp. Div. Caec. 10 ut in constituendo accusatore quid
sequi possitis habeatis.

ξ 39.

5 de Pharsalia fuga] ‘immediately after the flight from Pharsalus'‚
almost equivalent to ‘in the flight from Pharsalus’3 cp. the common Α
