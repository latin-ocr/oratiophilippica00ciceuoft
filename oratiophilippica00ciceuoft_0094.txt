oblivionem, but it was clearly an oversight in his own interest. Yet,
strange to say, yielding to the pressure of the Caesarian party, he
caused a special clause to be inserted in the law after it had been
engraved and deposited in the aerarium, making the requisite exception
in Caesar’s favour. This late addition was irregular, if not illegal, and
in consequence of these many changes of the law it was hard to define
Caesar’s exact position with respect to his candidature. It may be
noticed that Cicero’s account of his own action here is not quite easy to
reconcile with that given in Fam. VI. 6 ἓ 5 and Att. v11. 1 ἓ 4.

27 provideram] Cicero often speaks of his own politieal foresight3 in a
letter to Caecina Fam. VI. 6 (the whole of which should be read),
written about August 46, he says ‘ I would tell you of all my predictions
which have been verified, did Ι not sear that you would think me to be
prophesying after the event'. Some MSS have praevideram, but Cicero
very seldom uses praevidere, and Caesar never.

28 compositionis] ‘amicable arrangement’: cp. Caes. B. C. Ι. 32 legatos
ad Pompeium de compositione mitti oportere.

29 illa vox] ‘that expression ἐ we do not know on what occasion these
words were uttered; they are referred to in the letter to Caecina quoted
above, Fam. V1. 6 ἓ 4 plurimi sunt testes me et initio, ne coniungeret se
cum Caesare, monuisse Pompeium et postea ne se diiungeret: coniunctione
frangi senatus opes, diiunctione civile bellum excitari videbam.

30 coisses] coire societatem ‘to form an alliance’3 cognate accusative:
the phrase is also used of a trading partnership, cp. Rosc. Am. 20, 87,
96. Sometimes in or ad societatem is used, cp. Suet. Aug. 32 ad
nullius non facinoris societatem coibant 3 Tac. Hist. 111. 12 mos est
regibus, quotiens in societatem coeant, implicare dextras.

31 diremisses] so used of breaking up an alliance in Att. IV. 17 § 3
(Wesenberg) dirempta coitione.

gravitatis] ‘ dignity ⁹, ‘ sels-respect '.

p. 10. 2 concidisses] ‘would have collapsed': notice the tense and
contrast it with staret ‘would be standing ⁹.

g 25.

5 praevaricatorem] praevaricator was one, in the language of the
jurists, qui diversam partem adiuvat, prodita caussa sua, that is, one
who is in collusion with the opposite side. Cicero's argument is—when
my opponent charges me with being concerned in Caesar's murder,
