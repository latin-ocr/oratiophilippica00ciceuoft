XLIX( 113] NOTES. 141

5 valvae Concordiae] the folding doors of the temple of Concord; cp.
Phil. v. 18 opertis valvis Concordiae, from which it appears that the
doors had to be closed for security.

6 Ityraeos] cp. ξ 19: perhaps here the word is only a gloss on
barbaros.

8 miliens] miliens perire or mori was proverbial, ‘to die a thousand
deaths' 3 cp. Rab. 15 moreretur prius...miliens Gracchus quam Sec.

sua] ‘one's own '.

21 adulescentis] Brutus and Cassius, both over 40 years of age3 in ξ 118
