conspiracy of Catiline and was put to death by order of the
senate acting under the advice of Cato and Cicero. To this
event Plutarch attributes Antony's hatred for the latter. One of
his most intimate friends was the profligate C. Curio whose
father in vain attempted to withdraw his son from the demora-
lising connection. In 58 he was one of the associates of the
notorious P. Clodius, but soon after left Rome for the East
where, after a short sojourn in Greece for the purpose of study,
he served with distinction in Palestine and Egypt. On his
return from the East he betook himself to Caesar in Gaul, where
he might hope to gain fresh military experience and at the same
time be free from the persecution of his creditors. From Gaul
he returned in 53 to stand for the quaestorship, bearing a letter
of recommendation from Caesar to Cicero who befriended him
and aided him in his candidature. In 52 while still quaestor he
abruptly quitted Rome for Caesar’s camp in Gaul, returning
again in 50 at Caesaffs bidding and supplied from Caesar‘s
purse to stand for the augurship at Rome. He was successful,
and in the same year was also elected tribune, and became an
acknowledged leader of the democratic party who looked to
Caesar as their chief. In the early days of January 49 he vehe-

deliberations of that body upon the political deadlock between
the two great parties in the state. As is well known, no com-
promise could be effected. Antony fied from Rome to Caesar
who thereupon crossed the Rubicon. Henceforth we find
Antony fighting on his master⁷s side or carrying out his policy
in Italy, sometimes with more zeal than discretion. Cicero
has much to say of his reckless conduct when left in charge
of Italy as propraetor in 49. In the summer of 48 he fought at
Pharsalia. In the autumn he was made master of horse when
Caesar received the dictatorship for a year. In the following
year when Caesar received his third dictatorship, Lepidus suc-
ceeded Antony as master of the horse, probably because the
latter's wild and indiscreet behaviour had estranged him from
his chief. In 46 he married the ‘shrill tongu’d F ulvia‚' a
woman, as Plutarch says ‘who had no mind for spinning or.
