XLII 107] NOTES. 135

protection of a patronus were called his clientes. One sees here a
system which might have been developed into a representative parliament
for the Roman world.

magno...esse] ‘and they (treated them) with great zeal ἂι, not as
they did you and Basilus with violence and force of arms, you and
others like you, whom no one would care to have as clients‚ much less
to be your client ². The sentence is to our notions awkwardly expressed
srom the absence of the verb.

9 Basilum] nothing seems known of this person: no doubt he was a
member of the gens lllinucia to which belonged L. Minucius Basilus,
one of Caesar's murderers.

1 1 non modo] a curious inversion of the usual non modo...sed etiam : not
only would no one care to be their client but he would not even care to
have them as his clients3 this is expressed by saying ‘ whom no one
would care to have as his clients‚ not only (would no one care) to be
their client': consequently non modo is here equivalent to nedum, as
the simple non sometimes is.

12 qui dies] so Cicero Phil. Ι. 30 addressing Dolabella says quem potes
recordari in vita illuxisse tibi diem laetiorem quam cum expiato foro,
dissipato concursu impiorum...te domum recepisti? this was at the end of
April.

13 bustum] this sepulchral monument, erected by the impostor Amatius
on the spot where Caesar's body had been burnt, was in the form of a
column, cp. Suet. Caes. 85 solida columna prope viginti pedum lapidis
Numidici ; Phil. 1. 5 eversio illius exsecratae columnae (called bustum a
sew lines before) ; Att. XIV. 15 ἕ 2. Dolabella put down with a strong
hand the rising disorder in Rome after Caesar's death.

15 concidisti] ‘ you collapsed ’ 3 so in Greek συμπεσεῖν.

16 de caelo detraxisti] ‘you pulled him down from the heaven of his
renown', by bribing him: cp. Att. 11. 19 ξ 2 Bibulus in caelo est,
XIV. 17 A (addressed to Dolabella) cum te summis laudibus ad caelum
extulerunt3 the whole letter is full of the most extravagant eulogy; in
the next letter Cicero writes to Atticus in a different tone, having heard
of the bribery‚ Kal. Ian. debuit, adhuc non solvit, praesertim cum se
maximo aere alieno Faberi manu liberavit et Opem (observe the pun) ab
eo petierit3 in Att. XVI. 15 ἓ 2 he speaks of him as emptus pecunia.

18 dissimilis] so Phil. 1. 5 Cicero extolling Dolabella's former conduct

says ut milti mirum videatur tam valde reliquom tempus ab illo uno die
dissensisse.
